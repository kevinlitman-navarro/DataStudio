       "  'description': \"Pecan - 1 yr old petite female with some big opinions:\\n\\nI'm a little girl, sweet as a southern pie, most of the time. I am bouncy and spry, and I love to chase the laser light and dangly toys. I like some petting, a quick massage, but I'm not into a lot of snuggling, and I might swat you away when your time is up. You should know that  I can really get nutty around other cats. I've been around other cats and can definitely say that it's not for me!  But if it's just you and me and you're in to chilling out together after some active playtime, then we will be great companions.

       "  'description': 'Preble, NY 13141 \\n\\n\"Hello, everyone! My name is TONY. I am a 4 year old, 53 pound Pit/Boxer mix.\\n\\nI was already past due to be put down at a kill-shelter in New York City, when I was miraculously saved by a rescue because of a kind lady who offered to foster me. \\n\\nI completed a 6 week training class at PetSmart, and even received a diploma! I know sit, stay, lay down, come, wait, crate, drop it, leave it, and take it. I am crate-trained and walk well on a leash. My foster mom says I am VERY smart and that I learn quickly. I have lots of energy, so a home with a good sized yard or a quiet, nearby park would be best. \\n\\nDespite what I have been through, people are my favorite! I am a VERY affectionate boy. I love to sit close and snuggle. I love to throw myself over your lap and get my head and ears rubbed. \\n\\nBecause of my past, I am fearful of stranger dogs, but please donâ\\x80\\x99t let that deter you from adding me to your family! At my foster home, there are three other dogs who live there, and although I was afraid of them at first, they no longer scare me and we can live in harmony. It is believed that I do not like cats though, and a home with older children would probably be best because sometimes I get a little excited and like to jump.\\n\\nI hope to meet you soon!\"\\n\\nLove,\\nTony ?\\n\\nTony is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo learn more about Tony, email AmsterDog at amsterdog@gmail.com or apply to adopt at http://amsterdog.org/adoptionfoster-application/ .\\n\\nThank you for caring about a dog in need!',\n",

       "  'description': 'Philly, PA - Meet Jesse, a 4 year old 46 lb. Labrador/Border Collie Mix who is house broken, crate trained, neutered, up to date with all the shots, good with other dogs if properly introduced, (never tested with cats, but it will do if requested.)\\nFrom Jesse\\'s devoted foster mom:\\n\"Jesse came from the ACC in Manhattan where he was in the list to be destroyed. We are so glad that Jesse was rescued, but Jesse needs a special home where people can give him time to trust and not rush things. Jesse is very sweet, but needs patience and respect for his need to take things slowly. \\nJesse is a very unique dog, his personality is great! He talks to you all the time and if he is bored he will mumble around, like an old man, but he is anything but old! I think he is a lot of fun! Although he does not like to be grabbed (still), Jesse is sweet and likes to cuddle. He is very athletic so he would be a great companion for jogging, running or hiking. He would do excellent in agility. He is good on a leash and knows Sit, Stay, Give Paw, Down and Roll Over! Such a smart boy! \\nJesse would well in a home with children 10 years of age and up. To meet Jesse, please contact AmsterDog at 917 689 8414',\n",

       "  'description': 'BRUCE - 5 years old, 76 lbs Bruce would do best in a home without cats and as a single dog at this time. His foster parents write: Bruce likes long walks where he can sniff out pray and enjoys his butt scratched 24 hours a day. He enjoys to snack on apples, T-bone steaks, hamburger and all sorts of yummy things. But likes his vegetables also! Bruce loves to play but I recommend no indoor playing as he gets very excited and energetic! He is an exuberant love bug and deserves the best home and I hope with some teenage kids that he can run & play with. Even though Bruce is very strong he can be gentle as well and takes treats nice of your hand. Bruce needs time to warm up but is learning to give kisses and loves giving hugs. Bruce is amazing and super duper wonderful and deserves the best home! Bruce is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting this adventurous pal, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414 ',\n",

He was a family dog who was surrendered to the city shelter because his caretaker became ill and could no longer care for him. So, after living his whole 7 years with one family he wound up in strange surroundings. But the volunteers fell for him writing:\\n\\nWe volunteers were talking about Haze and agreed that he was such a pleasant dog to walk and spend time with. He is cute, too, medium sized, so silky, well groomed, well nourished and dressed a bit like a chipmunk. Haze is a gently mannered dog who is with us as his ailing owner could not care for a pet anymore. Haze is a good walker and minds his business with birds, squirrels, and other dogs. He is obedient, comes when called, sits on command and hops with help on the bench for cuddles. Haze was a bit hesitant at the beginning of our encounter, but a few minutes into our time together, the ice was broken. \\n\\nHaze needs a loving patient home who can earn his confidence which will yield undying love and cuddles. He deserves a second chance. Could it be with you?\\n\\n\",\n",

She seems to be ok around cats, and housebroken as long as she\\'s on a schedule. She does not like staying in a crate! She is playful, but not with toys. She\\'d rather play with clothes (a girlie girl). Let\\'s get her adopted so she can be dressed up and prance around and show her beautiful self off. \\n\\nPlease contact us DIRECTLY using the instructions below if you are interested in fostering or adopting one of our Waggytails! Visit our website (www.waggytailrescue.org) for an adoption or foster application on the CONTACT US page.

       "  'description': 'Diamond is a 5-6 year old, 6.8 pound spayed female Chihuahua / Mini Pincher! Just look at her petite frame and sweet chestnut eyes. She is looking for her forever home in NYC as she just flew here to the big apple from Los Angeles.\\n\\nDiamond is incredibly sweet with sultry eyes. Everyone who meets her falls in love with how quickly she snuggles up in your arms. She is very much a lady when it comes to everything she does. She adapts to any situation from cuddling in her bed, to going out shopping and even subways. She is always eager to go on car rides and sits patiently in her car seat throughout the ride. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a shy dame because she was recently surrendered to the shelter, so she needs a little TLC and has a little separation anxiety because she is heartbroken. She does well with other dogs and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t shy away from children. She is house-broken to go outside. She is quiet and a non-barker, but at times does whine when her human is not near. She is learning to find comfort in being alone and peanut butter is definitely her comfort food. \\n\\nDiamond gets along with dogs and cats.\\n\\nDiamond is up to date on shots and microchipped. She is scheduled to be spayed July 12th.\\n\\nDiamond was rescued in LA as part of our Waggy West rescue mission to bring At Risk dogs, one by one to NYC for adoption! We are always looking for volunteer chaperones to bring at risk dogs like him with them on their next LA-NYC flight, we pay the dog\\'s ticket and provide a carrier!

Find more adoptable pets, FAQs, and info on ways to contribute to the rescue world at socialteesnyc.org.\\n\\nWe suspect Vlad (who now answers to John) is a fairytale creature. He's too majestic and amazing to be a regular old dog (not that there's anything wrong with that). This shepherd mix is about 5 to 6 years old and 85 lbs. He is housebroken, walks well on a leash, and is super friendly with everyone and good with gentle kids! He's good with cats and small dogs, and he's a little picky with big dogs he meets but is fine with them when introduced properly -- he's just not a fan of dogs that get all up in his face. Vlad aka John is a great companion for walks and has good energy but is super melllow at home and mostly sleeps the day away. He has an adorable habit of nuzzling you with his snout when he wants affection, he hasn't experienced any separation anxiety or destructiveness in his foster home, and he is a great sleeper through the night. Vlad has an old injury in one of his hips that sometimes seems to bother him, but our vet said according to x-rays he just needs to take it easy on the exercise, and glucosamine might help. In general, he gets around fine though. He must be in a home out of the city because he is significantly more stresed in urban environemnts, and he loves long walks in nature. He also seems to really enjoy being with small dogs so maybe a small dog companion so he has his own pack. \\n\\nThis animal is not at the Social Tees office (325 East 5TH Street) â\\x80\\x94 all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youâ\\x80\\x99d like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best.

       "  'description': 'Basil is a super sweet lab mix, but kind of a scaredy cat. She\\'s a year old, about 50 lbs, and came from a home where she was barely socialized -- she\\'s jumpy around outdoor noises and can be shy in new situations, but she\\'s super smart, very eager to trust, learns fast, and settles in well once she\\'s had a day or two to chill out. She\\'s great with small dogs on the calmer side but seems to be afraid of bigger dogs and pups that come at her with too much playful energy. She walks okay on a leash but could use some more time outside getting used to the sights and sounds. She\\'s very playful, an awesome jogging partner, and a great cuddle companion indoors. Basil would do best in an active home ideally out of the city or in a quiet neighborhood where she can get a slower introduction to the wide world around her. She would get along great with another chill smaller dog for a buddy who can guide the way. Her foster dad says: \"This is our 6th time fostering. Basil was kind of a mess when I first picked her up, but she is a really quick leaner. She went from peeing the in house to only peeing outside in 2 days. She can be shy in public and startles easily, but definitely very curious and I see her warming up to other dogs, other people and the outside world pretty fast. I keep her away from dogs that are larger than her to help her confidence. She seems to be afraid of the crate as well, but we\\'re working on that too. At home she is very playful and loving -- definitely a snuggler! She has a lot of energy which I think is normal for labs especially a 1 year old. I run with her a couple miles every day. She\\'s a great running buddy! Doesn\\'t pull that much. I see her as a diamond in the ruff right now. With a little TLC and training she will be a great dog.\" Interested in adopting?

       "  'description': \"Bentley is a 55-lb, 9-month old, curly-tailed pup who we saved from death row at the kill shelter in NYC as a 6-month old in February 2018.  Bentley is very active and strong, and just wants to play all day.  He needs a lot of training and someone who has dog experience.  He loves other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog (or multiple dogs). \\n\\nDue to his strength and lack of training, only someone who is either strong enough to handle him should adopt him, or someone who has help in handling him.  His ideal situation would be in a home with more than one person and another dog, and a yard.  We have sent Bentley to training school in May 2018, and he has made a lot of progress, but it's important that whoever adopts him continues with that training and leads with a firm, yet humane, hand.  Bentley thrives in the presence of other dogs and is always submissive to them, so we can't reiterate enough that he really would do best in a home with another dog.  \\n\\nFor serious inquiries, please email FurRealNYC@gmail.com. \\n\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Momma is a 2-3 year old street dog from the North of Thailand who suffered immensely out on the streets as her babies were born into suffering, and all of them would die with each time that she would give birth.  An ex-pat rescuer stepped in and got her last litter of puppies and saved all 11 of them earlier this year.  Her daughter, Girl (shown in the fourth with her), from a litter she had over a year ago, was the only other survivor out of all of her babies born prior to this year.  She is very close with Girl and it is our hope that someone can at least foster them together for a few weeks while we search for a forever home for both of them, whether they are adopted together or separately.  \\n\\nShe is kind of scruffy looking and her fur is kind of wiry, and we know she's a hard sell, but if we didn't take this lady in, no one else would have ever helped her.  We believe in her and know that someone special is out there to give her the life she deserves, who will be patient with her and understand that the trauma she went through on the streets makes her shy until she gets to know someone.  Once she trusts someone, she is warm and affectionate.  If her daughter is near her, she will enact out affection on her to let you know she is starting to trust you.  For example, when she sees you, if she wants to jump up and hug you and lick you, she will instead do it to her daughter, to show you that she is happy to see you.  She just needs time and patience to win over her heart. She is not aggressive at all. \\n\\nFor serious inquiries to either FOSTER or adopt, please email FurRealNYC@gmail.com.  Thank you.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"MATT is a one year old 33 pound Rottie mixed with Pit. He is extremely loving and loves to be near his foster mom. He is a young boy who has heaps of energy but once he gets rid of it through normal doggy running and play, he's happy to just chill and cuddle. He transforms into the perfect lapdog!\\n\\nMatt shares his foster home with other dogs and is being trained to sleep in the crate at night. He recognizes his crate as a safe and happy place and never puts up a stink when it's time to go in there. While we have no problem with crate training, our goal for Matt is to one day be integrated into his forever home more completely. Either in the bed with his humans or in a dog bed close to his humans.\\n\\nIn the morning Matt is used to going right outside as he is still learning the ropes to housebreaking. He then gets his breakfast and does the cutest little twirly dance because he's beyond excited to get his food. \\n\\nMatt walks very well on the leash and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pull. He tries to chase squirrels here and there but can be very easily redirected. It seems like pure fun and NOT prey drive. He pulls slightly towards other dogs he sees on the way, but again, he can be very easily redirected. \\n\\nMatt is also crated when his foster mom leaves the home as she has other dogs who have free roam. While he's not a big fan of her leaving the barking is minimal and dissipates soon after she is gone. This level of separation anxiety is minor and will disappear completely when he is in a stable, loving forever home. In general, Matt is not a big barker. He doesn't bark when the doorbell rings nor does he charge the door. \\n\\nMatt is super smart and eager to please. Heâ\\x80\\x99s beginning to master the sit command like a champ. He's also very treat-motivated and takes them from your hands gently. He isnâ\\x80\\x99t a mouthy dog and would probably love a home with children who won't ride him, or pull his tail. In other words, kids must be over the age of 7 please!\\n\\nMatt is up-to-date on shots, neutered and microchipped. To meet him please go to our website and fill out an application: www.beastlyrescue.org/application\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Our magnificent Hero needs a hero of his own. This beautiful, robust boy is a victim of circumstances. His doting owner lost her home, and desperately tried to find housing to accommodate her beloved companion, whom she had raised from a pup. Hero's Mom took up temporary residence in a local motel, until she could get her bearings, but Hero was booted out by the motel manager. After a tearful goodbye, sad Hero was left in the care of a well-respected town shelter, who pled his case to us.\\n\\nHero appears to be a handsome mix of black Labrador Retriever and Border Collie. He has the physique and color of a black Lab, and the white tuxedo markings and black speckled white socks that suggest Border Collie. At 50 pounds, Hero has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Hero loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. \\n\\nHero sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the structure that he needs to to thrive. Hero gives the impression of caution at first, as he sizes up strangers, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. Adopters will need to be comfortable putting boundaries between Hero and strangers: he can become overzealous in guarding his person. He would be the ideal watchdog.\\n\\nHero seems subdued and intimidated at times, in the midst of our busy foster home, and we sense that a quiet, adult home would suit him best. He is not a big fan of change, and a steady, quiet routine will serve him beautifully.  Hero would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, can keep a brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Hero could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.\\n\\nHero has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. The obedience work serves him as a job he can take pride in, and he performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.\\n\\nHero has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Hero's transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DA2PP (distemper, adrenovirus, parvo and parainfluenza), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Hero, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info. \\n\\nEskies Online is a 501(c)(3) Multibreed rescue group that serves unwanted American Eskimos and other dogs in need.

       "  'description': \"Our stunning Wednesday enters the room like an arctic blast of cold on a hot summer night and grabs your attention! This magnificent one and a half year old, black Labrador Retriever mix came to us from a big city Animal Control facility, where she spent some time after a lackluster owners abandoned her. She was rail thin and gaunt when she entered the city shelter system, and took some time to adjust to her harsh surroundings. \\n\\nWhen Wednesday came to our Rescue, she was a wild child, a Black Beauty in need of some firm, loving leadership. It was painfully obvious that her owners had missed all of her social development cues, and woefully neglected her manners and leadership training. Wednesday was as precocious as her Addams Family namesake, and seemed to feel that her opinion was warranted on just about every subject.\\n\\nIn no time, Wednesday has developed into a canine thoroughbred, brimming with potential. An energy and personality match is key to Wednesday's happiness. She is a high energy, athletic dog who needs alot of outdoor exercise. She would gleefully keep rigorous pace with an avid runner, hiker or powerwalker, and seems to thrive in the brisk country air. No doubt about it, Wednesday needs an active adopter, but, also one who is extremely proficient in leadership and obedience training. She is not a dog for the casual or inexperienced adopter.\\n\\nWednesday largely appears to be Labrador Retriever, but we also suspect some Border Collie in her DNA. She is a lean, tall dog weighing 47 pounds, and is extremely graceful and athletic. She runs with great speed, and could be an agility champion. Wednesday has the energy and intelligence that we see in this high strung Herding breed, as well as the mischievious and impertinent tendency that sometimes occurs when Border Collies are under exercised and bored! \\n\\nAs a double dose of working dog, Wednesday definitely needs a job, and she is a natural at obedience work. She knows all her basic commands, and has passed many of the Canine Good Citizenship tests. She handles beautifully on lead, and heels nicely. Wednesday still needs some polish on her stranger manners, since she may, on occasion, greet someone rudely, but motivated adopters should be able to work her through any issues by employing her well honed commands. In the right hands, Wednesday will become a fantastic, well behaved companion.\\n\\nWednesday would fare best in an adult home, with adopters experienced in handling large, active breeds. She would overwhelm toddlers and seniors. She could easily join a multi-dog home, with another active, well trained dog, but sometimes, unruly and ill mannered dogs press her buttons. We have not had her around cats, but she would most likely chase them beyond their tolerance level.\\n\\nWednesday has respectable house manners and is mostly housetrained. She will need some finetuning on her potty routine as she transitions to a new environment. Wednesday is in good health, and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for rabies, bordatella, and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been microchipped and dewormed, and is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm treatment.\\n\\nIf you are interested in Wednesday, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738.\\n\\nEskies Online is a 501(c)(3) Multibreed rescue group that serves unwanted American Eskimos and other dogs in need.

       "  'description': 'Our Cupid is a sage soul, who found himself homeless, along with his housemate Eskie, Precious, after his family lost their residence. He entered the confines of NYC ACC, and did not fare well during the rescue process. He became shy, shut down, and suspicious of human touch, so Shelter workers directed him to us, so that we could evaluate him in a more hospitable environment.\\n\\nWe were happy to invite this sad soul to join us, and he has really come out of his shell in foster care. At first meeting, Cupid seems shy and reticent, but he warms quickly once he reconnects to a loving human vibe. He has adjusted beautifully to foster care, has been a joy to handle. Cupid loves people, and is generally friendly to strangers, once he warms up, but would be happiest in a quiet adult home, where he can chill out. \\n\\nCupid would be the ideal companion to an active single, or couple, who have large dog, or Rottie experience. Powerful breeds like Rottweillers and Hounds that have a work ethic bred into their DNA, require purposeful lifestyles that challenge their mental and physical faculties. They also need a strong pack leader to teach them Canine Good Citizenship.\\n\\nCupid has excelled in his obedience work, and this is a great way for an adopter to bond with him, and continue to assume a positive leadership role. Cupid has mastered all of his basic obedience commands, and adopters will be able to get him up to speed and into their lifestyle quickly. Cupid has a moderate energy level and does not require an untoward amount of exercise. A couple of brisk leash walks each day should do the trick and keep him happy and balanced.\\n\\nAs an adult dog, Cupid is calm and well behaved in the house. He could easily live in an apartment or home environment, and he would be fine during an 8-hour work day. He would also be happy as the companion to an active retiree with lots of time to spend with him. We think that Cupid may be too sensitive to tolerate young children, and we have not had him around cats. He could easily join a multi-dog home, as he seems to enjoy companionship with his own kind, and has become one of the superstars in our large dog play group.\\n\\nCupid has good house manners, and is house trained, to the best of our observation, although adopters need to have realistic expectations of Rescue dogs, who may lose some of their potty Mojo and they as they go from place to place during this unwieldy process. We expect adopters to troubleshoot any housetraining issues after the fact.\\n\\nCupid is in excellent health, and has been neutered. He is vaccinated for Rabies, Parvo, adrenovirus, distemper, coronavirus, leptopirosis, canine influenza, and bordatella. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.\\n\\nIf you are interested in Cupid, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com, or call/text Denise at cell: 860-908-9738 for an adoption application.\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'Our magnificent Panda an elegant quality that folks don\\'t expect in their Bully Breeds. This pretty boy has the bouyant good nature that attracts Bully breed folks to these lovable high energy scamps. No other dog group has been so overbred, mishandled and maligned as the Bullies, and we are thrilled to have Panda with us, at this young stage of his life, so that we can find his forever home.\\n\\nThree years old, Panda started off his rescue journey as a statistic: just one more homeless stray roaming the mean city streets. He was picked up and brought to NYC ACC. He hasc traversed the rescue process with ease, and has displayed great confidence and panache as he has interacted with everyone along the way. His behavior evaluations were exemplary, and he was used as a \"Social Greeter\" dog within the shelter\\'s behavioral Network, to help dogs feel at ease in the process.\\n\\nDespite good behavior evaluations, Panda was passed over for adoption in favor of the numerous puppies available. He was designated for the euthanasia list, but shelter workers managed to secure him a last minute foster home spot in their Network, and he was sitting pretty for a few months. Unfortunately he was attacked by another dog on the street, and was returned to the shelter with some minor wounds to treat. \\n\\nShelter staff sent Panda to us, so that we could continue his foster care and find his forever home. He joined us a few months ago, along with Celia, another large bully, and they quickly became great friends. Panda appears to be a mix of American Pit Bull Terrier and black Labrador Retriever suggested by his graceful stance and height. He is a large strong dog at 60 pounds, with a lean, muscular physique, and floppy Lab ears. He has a broad skull that suggest some Bully DNA, but his muzzle narrows into a triangular Lab shape. He has a wide swath of white, sweeping down his chest that gives him a regal tuxedo look. Panda truly represents the best of beauty and temperament in both breeds. He has charmed everyone he has met, in the face of trying circumstances.\\n\\nPanda would be a fantastic choice for a Lab or Bully breed lover, who is willing to continue his exercise and obedience regimen. Panda is high energy, and needs adequate exercise. He loves to be on the go: the more action, the better. A bored, frustrated Bully will make mischief, to be sure, but in the hands of dedicated breed enthusiasts, who rejoice in their high energy companions, Bullies are Man\\'s devoted BFFs.\\n\\nPanda is an ideal choice for an active single or couple. He is friendly, and good with most strangers, but he would likely overpower young toddlers. We haven\\'t had him around cats, but he likes most other well mannered dogs. He loves to play with other dogs matched to him for size and energy level, and would be a great companion to another well-trained dog.\\n\\nPanda has excelled at his obedience training and is extremely food motivated. He responds well to positive reinforcement training, and has learned all of his commands, so that adopters will be able to get up to speed with him quickly. He has great house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters will need to forgive the occasional accident that might occur as Panda transitions to a new potty routine, in a new home. \\n\\nPanda has been thoroughly vetted. Like many bully breeds, his sensitive skin will benefit from a grain free diet rich in quality protein and Omega fats. He has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo and parainfluenza, coronavirus), and has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Panda, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Our winsome Juicy loves to mug for the camera with a \"Sad Sack\" expression but then amps up the puppy play vibe in real-time! This lanky girl came to us from New York Animal Care and Control, where she found herself, after a brief run as a city stray. Juicy was on a stray hold, while shelter workers frantically tried to reach her owner, but sadly no one could be found. At that point she had caught the typical shelter virus, and was quickly relegated to the euthanasia list.\\n\\nJuicy is a comical girl and has a string bean physique that makes us think of Popeye\\'s Olive Oil. We are convinced that she has some sighthound DNA! At first glance, Juicy appears to be an American Pitbull Terrier, but she\\'s very tall and weighs only 35 lb. Juicy has a dramatic color pattern of black and white patches, strategically placed over eyes to give her the look of double \"shiners\". Like many Bullies, Juicy has sensitive skin, and does best on a grain-free diet high in Omega fats.\\n\\nJuicy would make a great companion to an active single or couple who love to walk, hike or run. She is a natural athlete, and loves to spend time outdoors. Two years old, Juicy is well past the puppy destructive stage, but still has vibrant puppyish energy. She is extremely smart and has responded well to her obedience work. She has the potential to be a Canine Good Citizen.\\n\\nJuicy is a friendly girl, who likes everyone, and has not shown any \"stranger danger.\" She would be fine with older kids, but toddlers might overstimulate her. She could join a multi-dog home, and is generally good with most polite and well trained dogs. Juicy does not care for ill-mannered dogs, who do not respect her boundaries. She will readily rebuke a dog who gets in her face. We think that she might chase cats in play, perhaps beyond their comfort level.\\n\\nJuicy has decent house manners for a young adult, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect the occasional accident as she transitions to a new home. Juicy is in excellent health, and is spayed. She is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza coronavirus, canine influenza, and bordatella. She has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.\\n\\nIf you are interested in Juicy, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com, or call/text Denise at cell: 860-908-9738 for an adoption application.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Our tiny Oscar came to us last year as an emergency case from NYC ACC. This tiny 10 pound Miniature Pinscher-Dachshund mix had been hit by a car and was incapacitated by the side of the road when good samaritans brought him to the shelter for medical care.\\n\\nIt's amazing that Oscar survived his injuries, which were extensive. He had a fractured lower jaw that left his muzzle swollen and painful. Also, he sustained a fractured hip, which would require surgery in the near future, once his considerable soft tissue injuries and swelling subsided.\\n\\nAfter several months of TLC, surgery, and medical care, Oscar is 100 percent, and ready for his new home. And yet, the trauma of such an injury leaves some wounds on the spirit. Oscar needs a patient adopter, with some rescue chops, willing to troubleshoot unpredictable behavior with some strangers, and some initial handling issues, due to random aches and pains caused by his injuries. Oscar has shown us that he can bond like glue to his loving handlers, and accept gentle touch, but there will be some likely ups and downs in the first couple of weeks as he adjusts to new people.\\n\\nOscar is a gentle, shy boy, who needs patience to allow him time to warm up and bond. He will thrive in the quiet home of a laid back single or couple, and perhaps another good natured dog, or friendly cat, to help him adjust. He's not a good candidate for hectic family life, and he will surely be spooked by the overzealous affections of toddlers.\\n\\nOscar is a medium energy dog, and needs a couple of leisurely walks each day, with an assertive handler, who has earned his trust. He is an energetic little Scamp, who loves to be in the middle of the action. We have begun him on a basic obedience routine, and he seems happy to work for treats and praise. The obedience training process has gone a long way toward building Oscar's confidence. Adopters should continue him on a training regimen to develop his potential. Confident leadership is the key to success with Oscar.\\n\\nOscar has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters must have appropriate expectations of a recently neutered dog, and be willing to fine tune potty habits as Oscar adjusts to a new routine.\\n\\nJust five years old, Oscar is in excellent health, and has bounced back nicely from his injuries. He has been neutered and vaccinated for rabies and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been microchipped and dewormed.

At first, Spice showed some fearful behavior to shelter staff and volunteers, and finally, we were called in on Spice\\'s behalf, so that he could have space to unwind and decompress before adoption. We are thrilled that Spice is with us, and he has blended beautifully into his new foster home, quickly adapting to house rules.\\n\\nSpice is a five year old, adult Chihuahua, who looks like he\\'s on stilts! There\\'s no mistaking the Chi Apple head, But the floppy ears and long, long legs, suggest a bit of Italian Greyhound. His personality favors the outspoken and opinionated Chihuahua, rather than the nervous IG. At 9 pounds, he is a tiny boy, with a lean, athletic physique built for the Peewee high jump. He would be a great choice for an experienced Chihuahua lover who relishes the creative, comical hijinks that this whimsical breed is famous for.\\n\\nSpice would do well in the active home of a single or couple who have the time to focus on his exercise and obedience work. Or, he could join a busy family lifestyle, where he could flounce around as the center of attention. Spice loves human contact, but can become nervous around toddlers. He would enjoy the gentle attention of older kids or teens, and would fit in nicely in a multi-dog home. Spice might be fine around cats, but a cat-dog introduction would be necessary before any decision is made.\\n\\nSpice has excellent house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to forgive the occasional accident as Spice adapts to his new potty routine. He travels well, and is an ideal car passenger. He is small enough to fit into the airline approved Sherpa bag, and would be a great companion on plane trips.\\n\\nSpice appears to be well cared for: his skin and coat are soft and lustrous, and his teeth and gums are in good shape for an adult dog. A consistent dental care plan will go a long way to avoid future dental cleanings and extractions. Spice is in excellent health and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and had a negative fecal test. If you are interested in Spice, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Our lovely Chanel is a gregarious beauty who loves everyone! She recently joined us from a New Jersey shelter, where she had spent some time after her verklempt Owner dropped her off, amid personal crisis. After charming staff and receiving great behavior evaluations, Chanel was passed over in the shelter adoption program, so she came to us so that we could find her perfect home.\\n\\nChanel appears to be a pretty mix of Siberian Husky and Samoyed. She has one brown eye and one blue eye, as a nod to her Husky heritage. Chanel is a stocky, plus sized girl, who rocked the scale at 99 pounds upon arrival. She's at the beginning of her much-needed weight loss journey, and she's already down 11 pounds. At ideal weight, Chanel should be in the 65 to 70 pound range. \\n\\nChanel has the thick double coat that we see in Samoyeds, with a good deal of biscuit coloring. Her mid length, fluffy coat requires regular brushing, but is easy to groom, and Chanel enjoys the grooming process. Chanel seems more like the magnanimous Samoyed in personality: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. And yet, she seems to have a slight sadness about her, and is likely feeling confused and disoriented with the rescue process.\\n\\nChanel has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. She certainly is food motivated, and will respond to positive rewards based training as well as leadership work. Chanel would be the ideal family dog. She can be trusted with older kids, and generally does not fear strangers. Chanel is not the type of dog to pick one family member over the other. Rather, she will spread the love evenly and ingratiate herself to everyone.\\n\\nChanel is easy to walk on lead and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee. She has a tendency to overeat, so attention must be paid to appropriate portion size and to a moderate exercise regimen so that Chanel can continue her weight loss. She would be the ideal walking or hiking companion, but then she can be counted on to take a long nap afterwards.\\n\\nChanel would be a great choice for a moderately active family, single or couple, or a recent retiree. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Chanel seems to get along with other dogs, and she could easily join a multi-dog home, and possibly even a feline home. Chanel is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where the next phase of her life will be spent center stage, rather than considered dosposable.\\n\\nChanel has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. At the age of four, Chanel is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and she has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, microchipped and is on preventatives for Heartworm and Flea/Tick. If you are interested in Chanel, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Our lovely Mama suffered a tortuous intake process at NYCACC, after her owner repeatedly berated her in the crowded shelter Lobby. Our shelter contact witnessed the verbal tongue-lashing and watched in horror as Mama cowered, and shook spastically throughout the entire intake. As Mama was led into the back kennel area, we were called and ask to help her.\\n\\nMama is one of those dogs who just brightens the room whenever she enters. It's amazing that such a lovely creature could be so callously abandoned at the age of ten. Mama is a grand old gal, who needs a happy retirement home to spend her golden years. She had earned stellar behavior evaluations, and was placed in the Shelter adoption program, only to be passed over because of her age. \\n\\nAlthough Mama was a favorite among shelter staff and volunteers, her adoption options were limited. Seems that everybody wants to experience puppy hell, and too few people appreciate the considerable benefits of having an older dog, who is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She came to our rescue so that we could cast a wide net, and find her just the right Adopter. \\n\\nMama appears to be a pretty mix of American Foxhound with a smidge of Boxer that adds some strength to her physique. She is a lean, statuesque beauty at an athletic weight of 45 pounds. Her short, flat coat requires minimal grooming, and Mama enjoys the grooming process. Her coat mostly is white with russet brown patches, and scattered black markings on her face. Mama seems more like the elegant Boxer in personali: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. She exudes happiness and joy.\\n\\nMama has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. Mama is easy to walk on lead, and has a moderate exercise level.

She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Mama has excellent pack manners, and would be a great addition to a multi-dog household, perhaps as a companion to a senior dog who has lost his or her housemate. Mama is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where her golden years will be spent as the light of someone's life, rather than considered an afterthought.\\n\\nMama has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained.

He is silly and sweet with lots of personality quirks. With a medium energy level and the ability to keep himself amused, combined with the fact that he is non-destructiveÂ\\xa0when being left alone, he is a dream dog for just the right person. He loves giving LOTS of kisses and spending time with his family. He has the funniest personality to match his goofy ears.\\n\\nPeeWee is a little shy when meeting new people but he quickly warms up and wants to make friends. He is very dog selective and would be best as the only dog in the house. He doesn't like being in a crate but is very well behaved when being left alone. He is housebroken and walks nicely on a leash although he much prefers hanging out in the backyard over going for a walk.\\n\\nPeeWee's perfect forever family is one that has a yard for him to romp around in and has experience with terriers.

He greets everyone with his goofy smile, lots of kisses, and wagging tail .\\n\\nMarshall is smart too! As soon as he is told to go to his bed, he listens. He is a gentle boy and takes treats softly out of your hand.\\n\\nAlthough Marshall is playful and fun, he is just as happy to curl up and sleep when he is inside. He may occasionally steal a shoe to sleep with, but he never chews it or damages it in any way. He just snuggles with it. Such a goofy boy!\\n\\nMarshall is medium energy. He loves going for walks or  to romp around. He finds his favorite sticks and trots along happily bringing it on a walk. He makes doggie friends easily and loves to run and play with his new friend. He can outrun just about every dog he meets.\\n\\nAlso, be prepared to get lots of compliments. Marshall is quite handsome and has lots of admirers. People constantly stop us to comment on how stunning Marshall is.\\n\\nAlthough Marshall is sweet and loving, he is an anxious boy. When he gets overly scared or overwhelmed he has snapped (strangers moving very fast or if he thinks his family is in danger).  Because of this, we are looking for a home for Marshall outside of the city, and with no small children. Marshall is great with passing everyone on the street and he loves children, but given his anxiety at new things, we think he would do best living with adults who understand him and can make him feel safe and confident. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, all he just wants are belly rubs. Marshall is super lovable and just wants to please.\\n\\nFor more information about sweet Marshall please fill out an application and email Julie@ALRcares.com.\\n\\n',\n",

She is friendly and outgoing.\\n\\nShe is 22 pounds, but recently had a litter so she still has a bit of baby weight left!  Our guess is that she is 3 years old and a Beagle Chihuahua mix - a Cheagle? \\n\\nMia is such a sweetheart. She is happy, affectionate, and on the calmer side. She is great with other dogs, kids, and even cats. She's just the sweetest!  She will\\xa0be happiest outside the city noises.\\n\\nMia was found wandering the street with her sister who was also pregnant at the time. Our rescuers in Puerto Rico scooped them up and took care of them, helping to deliver the babies safely! Mia is currently being fostered in NYC. \\n\\nFor more information on Mia please email Leanna@ALRcares.com and complete an application on our website www.ALRcares.com\",\n",

Coal, a 13-year old, 25-pound, Labrador/ terrier mix is a lot like your favorite pair of old, broken-in shoes: Cozy, comfy and irreplaceable. A new pair would NEVER feel quite the same!\\n\\nCoal has been around the block so to speak, and guess what? He STILL loves to go around the block! Leash this fella up and he'll excitedly accompany you on a stroll through the 'hood, sniffing and greeting creatures along the way!\\n\\nAt home, he is content to sit with you on the couch (by invitation only!) or find a soft warm dog bed to plop down on. He is not separation anxiety-ridden, in-your-face kinda guy! Nice, huh? This easy-going cutie-pie has a healthy appetite, pretty much eats anything and is particularly fond of treats. Feed me, feed me, feed me! Oh, and guess what? He's also housebroken...yay!..and pad-trained too...double yay! He does not act his age and has energy! He knows simple commands such as sit and come. Coal will do best with a patient owner that understands he needs to build up trust. \\n\\nCoal does not hear as well as he did when he was a younger lad, but he navigates his world like a champ and only asks that you approach him gently so as not to startle him. He enjoys a tender touch, he hardly barks, sleeps through the night, can co-exist with other respectful dogs and isn't much of a shedder. \\n\\nCoal isn't some old, sooty, dirty, fossil fuel...nope, nope, nope! He's a sweet, floppy-eared, adorable, black-and-silver coated senior gentleman who deserves a low-key retirement home where he can hang his hat and enjoy some serious lovin'!\\n\\nIf you would like to adopt this Rockstar, please email PupStarzRescue@gmail.com or visit www.pupstarzrescue.org for an application!  \\n\\nwww.pupstarzrescue.org \\nPlease Follow us on Instagram: @pupstarzrescue\\nLike us on FaceBook! www.facebook.com/PupStarzRescue\",\n",

Alyssum (Ally for short) is a 15-week old (as of 7/1), 9-pound Harrier / Hound mix, who is as lovable as she is eye-catching. \\n\\nThis lighthearted pup is sweet and easy-going with everyone, including little kids all petting her at once. She gets along fine with dogs and cats too! Ally is energetic, appreciates a couple of healthy robust walks, and can party like a rock star, but she also has the ability to mellow out and quietly amuse herself. When sheâ\\x80\\x99s done with all of that, napping is her game of choice! Once bedtime rolls around, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be down for the count and will not disturb your slumber until the following morning. \\n\\nAlly is fully housebroken, uses wee-wee pads for emergencies only, and is crate-trained. For such a little one, thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty remarkable. She is one smart cookie and always aims to please. \\n\\nThis furry angel is as gentle as they come and not mouthy at all. If you didnâ\\x80\\x99t actually see her chewing on her bones, youâ\\x80\\x99d almost think she had no teeth! Sheâ\\x80\\x99d make a great addition to almost any type of household.

       "  'description': 'Long Island: Snoopy is a 4 year old, 50 lb sweet cow print guy who has been in boarding ever since we pulled him from death row. We had pulled him for an adopter who bailed on him and he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t gotten one application since. Snoopy is not doing well in boarding, he is nervous and very sad. Snoopy likes his caretakers and is friendly with them but he really wants a family to call his own. What we know about him is that Snoopy has lived with his former owner since he was a few weeks old, he has lived with a 2 year old child but has been around kids of all ages. He is playful, respectful, and tolerant of the kids. He plays in an exuberant manner with adults and plays in a gentle manner with kids. He has never lived with any kind of animal and ignores dogs when walked. He has never bitten a person or animal. Snoopy has no behavior issues and will hide during storms. Snoopy is not bothered if food or a treat of any kind is touched while he is eating. He is not bothered if a toy is taken away, if pushed off furniture, if held, if disturbed while sleeping, if brushed, during nail trimming, or if someone unfamiliar approaches owner or family member. He enjoys bath time. He will bark if someone knocks on the door. Snoopy is friendly, playful, affectionate, and confident with a medium to high activity level. Snoopy likes to play with rope style toys. He likes to play tug and fetch. He is kept indoors only and sleeps in his own bed. If left home alone Snoopy is well behaved. Snoopy will sleep in the crate if the door is left open. He knows commands like sit, stay, and give me five. On leash Snoopy does not pull and off leash he wanders but comes back when called. If you think you are the perfect match for the much overlooked Snoopy please  email rhdrdoggies@gmail.com to find out more information.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Meet Carmelo! \\n\\nThis fluffy boy wandered into our vet's backyard in Puerto Rico and started playing with her dogs. He was shy, but was so desperate for friendship! She brought him inside and he was amazingly sweet and gentle with her kids and cats too!\\n\\nCarmelo is still on the shyer, mellower side. He is only 30 lbs (he looks bigger in the photo) and just wants a family to love and love him back. A home outside the city would be best so he can acclimate easier, but kids and other animals are all welcome. \\n\\nCarmelo is about 1-2 years old. He is fully vetted, vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. He arrives in August. If interested in adopting him, please submit an application here: https://www.thesatoproject.org/applicationform\\n\",\n",

He is a friendly, outgoing cat, who likes to talk.  His sister is a little more reserved.  In a large shelter, he was neutral, but allowed petting and being picked up.  In a quieter setting, he is quite friendly and interactive.  He has made good progress on becoming a trimmer cat.  He was rated overweight, but now is a healthy weight.  Sine these two cats know each other (and also know Michelle, from the same home), they might be a good choice for someone wanting to adopt two cats together.  To adopt Joshua and/or Rachel or Michelle, call 347 244-2377.',\n",
