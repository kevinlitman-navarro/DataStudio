Some things:

- As with previous data explorations, I just feel like I need to bring in more data to form any real conclusions

- I was mad struggling with making charts that I wanted, then we learned how to transform long data to wide data and my life changed 

- Making labels align properly in matplotlib was a nightmare

- Comparing two different classes of things (in this case cats v dogs) when the samples are different sizes is a pain. I used percentages for the most part to make accurate comparisons, but it's a major bummer to deal with this
