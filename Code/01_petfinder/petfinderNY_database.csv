"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noDogs', 'noKids']",Adult,Cat,Tabby,"Lincoln (#A1017544) was saved from the ACC's At Risk list as a terribly shy 14 week old kitten.  Lincoln had been found alone, surrendered alone and would have died alone had Place For Cats not intervened to save his dear life.

Lincoln's timidity upon arrival was heart-wrenching.  When held he melted into a little ball of fluff in your hands.  Despite loving care in a few different foster homes, Lincoln remains inordinately shy with people. Lincoln nonetheless has gotten along very, very well with his kitty foster mates in each home.   He is very polite, in cat-speak.  He is not aggressive with other males who are dominant in the household.  Lincoln has been particularly beloved by tiny kittens who come into the foster locations, as he quickly becomes ""Uncle"" Lincoln to the orphaned babes.  In short, Lincoln is a sweet cat, submissive to other felines, but frankly, absolutely terrified of people.  

Despite serious efforts, Lincoln has not evolved into a lap cat.  Going into a new home, we predict that it will takes months for his new person to earn his trust.  Eventually, Lincoln will sleep on the bed as long as his person doesn't want to cuddle.  Once he is familiar with you, Lincoln allows affection such as brief back & head rubs during meal time but otherwise, to date, has remained too scared of people to allow loving physical interaction.  

Lincoln would do best in a home with a caregiver who would allow him to be his independent self, without obligation to participate in physical interaction.   Lincoln would be happy to be alone in a big house where there might be mice to chase. 

Lincoln is FeLV/FIV negative, current in vaccinations, neutered and micro-chipped.  He is three years old as of January 2018 and has never required treatment for any ailment in the past 3 years.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"ROOSIE (short for ROOSEVELT) is a nice easy-going 1 to 2 year-old rescued boy kitty. ROOSIE has that deep, gentlemanly ""meow"" that just makes you want to hold him tight and reassure him that all is alright.    

ROOSIE is neutered, micro-chipped, current in vaccinations and FeLV negative.  He is FIV positive but he is NOT sick.  Because he is healthy and asymptomatic it is possible that his former person gave him the FIV vaccination.

Princess has grown into a very smart and healthy adolescent who plays all the time, loves her foster kitty-mate, Murry; and has maintained her sleek appearance even after being spayed.  She has a model's figure - slender and delicate - but she is strong. Princess is agile, figures out difficult high jumps and makes them with ease. 

Princess is FeLV/FIV negative, current in vaccinations, microchipped and spayed.   We prefer that Princess and Murry be adopted together as they have had each other since kittenhood.

Murry came in with an egregiously ruptured eye.  It took forever for Murry to gain the weight necessary to have eye surgery.  Eye ointment was administered for months before the globe to recede back into the socket before he was ready.  Dr. van der Woerdt at the Animal Medical Center removed what remained of his destroyed eye, and now he is the handsome dude you see in the picture.

As a kitten, Murry had no clue that he was handicapped.  As a highly energetic adolescent he still has no clue that he's missing an eye.  One could not ask for a better adjusted feline.  And, it's impossible to take a bad picture of him, dashing, debonair darling that he is.   Isn't he HANDSOME????

WILHELMINA is a nice, healthy, somewhat reserved adolescent who looks to her brother, WINSTON, for play, affection and companionship. WINSTON is a strapping youngster whose sweet face will melt your heart. He was born in our care to a healthy mama kitty rescued from the streets in Queens and has remained a best friend to WILHELMINA.   WINSTON is more outgoing, friendly, active and courageous.  Both WILHELMINA and her brother have teeny-tiny little meows that make you just want to hold them tight and never let them go.

WILHELMINA & WINSTON are healthy, current in vaccinations, FeLV/FIV negative, microchipped and neutered/spayed.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"Place For Cats pulled TIGER from NYC Animal Care Center's death list.  The sweet, loving boy had a bite of unknown origin which resulted in a Department of Health hold for 6 months.  After much ado, we got the go-ahead to put TIGER into foster care.  TIGER is very friendly, loves to be petted and, according to the ACC intake papers, came from a location where he got along with other animals.   Here is the link to TIGER's earlier profile:  http://nyccats.urgentpodr.org/tiger-17360/

TIGER is now healed of the bite wound, FeLV/FIV tested negative, up to date in vaccinations and neutered.  He has been a champ in foster care.  Part of the DOH 6 month quarantine requires that he have frequent vet checkups all of which he has passed with flying colors.  (Kudos to his foster parents for taking time from work to make the frequent trips to and from the clinic.)  TIGER is available for adoption June, after his quarantine ends. 

While we are eager to meet all prospective adopters, we ask that we have your application in advance of scheduling a meet-and-greet with our foster home(s). You may download the application here: http://www.placeforcats.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PFC-Adoption-Application.pdf

This lovely, healthy and sweet kitty was left behind by her careperson who had to return to China last year.  MARU has been cared for by a friend who loves her but cannot keep her due to constant out-of-town extended assignments.  

MARU is 5 years old, spayed, up-to-date in vaccinations, FeLV/FIV negative and will be microchipped prior to adoption.  Her caretaker describes that MARU has an anxious personality that manifests in the presence of strangers or new surroundings.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Cat,American Shorthair,"At around 1 year old, Raven is an adorable, cuddle baby with tons of energy. She's a goofy character with beautiful markings. She loves playing with her fish on a string, and has learned how to toss around tinfoil recently. After tiring herself out, Raven loves to sleep on your belly, chest, or wrapped around your head. She was rescued from the streets and can take a little time to get used to new people but isn't shy and responds wonderfully to affection (and lots of attention). 

Raven is a very high energy, frisky, active cat and will get herself into mischief if you can't provide her with lots of fun things to do. 

Raven has a mild case of stomatitis. Feline stomatitis is thought to be autoimmune in nature.The feline immune system seems to overreact to dental plaque around a cat's teeth, triggering inflammation in the tissues of the mouth. The problem also occurs on the back of the throat at the oral pharynx, and even underlying bone in the mouth can become inflamed or infected. Stomatitis inflammation appears externally in the mouth as angry, red, swollen tissue.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,Poodle,"You're my heart, and my heart is yours, is the motto of adorable 10-12 year old, 20lb, Patti LaBelle. Patti was found as a stray and we have no clue how this perfect little lady ended up homeless. Patti is the perfect dog for anyone who enjoys long nights in front of the fire, cuddlefests and treat time. Sheâs also great to take a slow stroll with, happy to say hello to other dogs and loves a day at the beauty parlor. Patti is an easy going dream dog who cannot wait to find her forever home.

Patti has no serious health problems, although she is a little hard of hearing. Being an older lady, she does not jump and needs assistance to get nto furniture and up and down stairs. She is over weight and needed to have 27 of her teeth removed as her dental health was neglected. She would benefit from daily teeth cleaning and dental chews. Managing these two issues will help Patti have many health years ahead of her. Patty should ideally weigh approximately 15 lbs.

Patti enjoys going on walks and needs to continue gentle exercise to help her lose weight, however she is trained to use pee pads and will use them if given access to them.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Cat,American Shorthair,"Meet cute little Winifred, you can call her Winnie or Wednesday or Winnipeg. She is a tiny cat with big personality. Winnie is less than 18 months old, but sheâs already had at least one litter of kittens. Formerly a feral little girl, Winnie was originally spayed with the idea that she would be released back in the area she was trapped, which is why she is rocking that clipped ear. Winnie had often been found scrounging for food and trying to start her own street gang by a friend of Shelter Chicâs. Although she was a diamond in rough, this kind Samaritan trapped her and paid for all the vet expenses out of her own pocket. When Winnie was well enough to return to her old life, our dear friend thought maybe she would give Winnie the choice to see if she would prefer a fresh start as a pampered kitty. Most feral cats have a very hard time making the transition but sweet little Winnie become a house cat almost immediately! She is a smart girl who knows a good opportunity when she sees one ; )

She now loves being inside, and being around other cats. She's is still not a big fan of being held, but she is happy to be around people...especially when they have food. She loves to grab food out of your hands (or swat it down to her level), particularly chicken, and will sleep near your head on the back of the couch when youâre watching tv. She would do best in a home with another cat as she loves curling up next to others, and needs someone who has the patience to work with her on becoming more comfortable with people. 

She is also good with dogs - well certainly not intimidated by them! She has no problem getting into their face and trying to steal food when they are getting a burger or chicken as a special treat. She is very food motivated, which is very helpful to teach her to be more relaxed around people. She will always be the first to check out what everyone is eating.

 Winnie is looking for an experienced cat owner or someone who has other cats and is not looking for a snuggle buddy. Although friendly and keen to be around you, she does not want to cuddle and if that works for you, she will be a great addition to your family, plus she is super stinking cute. :)

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Cat,American Shorthair,"Beautiful, 10 year old, 14lb Greysha is a stunningly perfect cat who can make herself at home with any cat lover.

Greysha was bought from a pet shop as a tiny kitten and spent the next 10 years in what she thought was her forever home. When her owner's grandson was diagnosed with asthma, Greysha was taken to the city shelter where she was quickly put on the euthanasia list since she was a senior cat with a cold. 

Scared and alone, Greysha, (who had not seen a vet in 4 years) did surprisingly well at winning over staff and volunteers. Although she can be shy around strangers, she has curious and loving spirit which means that no one is a stranger for long. After hearing her story we couldnât wait to make Greysha a part of the Shelter Chic family and move her into a wonderful foster home where she has been a complete angel.

She loves people of all ages, actively seeking attention and body rubbing against your legs to make sure you know sheâs still there. She enjoys having her coat brushed and is always happy to be picked up and cuddled. She will sleep anywhere, but would prefer to snuggle up next to you at night. She loves tuna as a special treat, (although she does need to lose a few pounds,) and enjoys scratching posts and cat nip toys.

Greysha is a low energy, friendly, affectionate, confident cat who canât wait to find her new forever home.

If you are interested in him, please email info@shelterchic.org directly or follow the Petstablished link listed at the bottom of his profile to be considered for adoption. Thank you!

Hey now, Bobby McGee is the sweetest new man about town. Approximately 6 years old and 8 lbs, underweight Bobby needs some extra yummies to get him to his ideal weight.

Bobby is an easy going, low maintenance, quiet, love bug.

Bobby was surrendered to the shelter after his owner found he was throwing up and not using his litter box. Rather than taking Bobby to the vet, they changed his litter, then his brand of food and then gave up. But poor Bobby was trying to tell them that he was in pain. His teeth were in such terrible shape that he could not eat properly and he could not bear to have his face touched.

After a trip to the dentist to get his teeth cleaned, Bobby received a clean bill of health and has been eating and using his litter box without incident.

Bobby only lived with his previous owner for a year before they gave up on him, so we do not know where he came from. Bobby has lived with adults (but no children), he has spent time around two small dogs that he was fine with, as long as they did not bother him. Bobby did not enjoy living with another cat. They would regularly fight, and although this may have been an issue with that particular cat, we believe Bobby would prefer to be the only cat in his home.

Bobby is very gentle and friendly. He likes cuddles, sitting on laps, and catnip toys. Because Bobby is so thin, he is eating a prescription diet to ensure his weight loss is not due to allergies or IBS. He is now steadily gaining weight.

If you think you can give Bobby all the love he deserves and would like to meet him, please go to Petstablished.com or follow the link below to complete an application to adopt.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'American Staffordshire Terrier']","Celine Dion is an adorable, mini girl, at around 30 lbs and approximately 1 year old, who has seem some hard times in her short life.

Found as a stray, Celine was taken to city shelter with a terrible cold. Weak and malnourished, it took her almost a month to recover the strength to be put up for a adoption. She joined the Shelter Chic family with an ear infection and some itchy skin, but ready to start a new chapter in her life.

Celine is an absolutely cuddle bug, she adores being with people and loves to snuggle on the couch to watch TV with you. She also loves to play, run and is eager to learn new tricks.

Celine would benefit from some basic training classes and practice meeting new dogs. At the moment she is shy and unsure of herself and although she did wonderfully with her official dog test, occasionally she gets nervous, especially since she is still a little weak and will not socialize with other dogs.

Celine is adjusting well to living in the city, but would ultimately be happier living in the suburbs with a yard of her own.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Chinese Crested Dog,"Whitney is an adorable Powderpuff Chinese Crested dog. At around 1 year old, and around 8lbs, Whitney is gentle, happy, loving and absolutely obsessed with people. If she can be glued to your side from now on, she will be very happy.

Whitney is a small, delicate dog who is not suitable for young children or larger dogs who play rough. She will be happiest living with adults and older children who have a lot of time to dedicate to her. Whitney is not a dog who would enjoy being home alone if you work long hours, but she is quite happy to take a nap while you are out running errands. It will be important to show Whitney that being home without you is not a problem and you should frequently leave her for short periods to prevent her from developing separation anxiety. If youâre looking for a dog that will be devoted to you, Whitney is your girl!

As lovers of this breed will know, powderpuff and hairless pups can be born in the same litter, and Whitney is a great example of that, as she has one hairless patch on her back. 

See more pictures and learn more about Whitneyâs story on our instagram pages @shelterchic and @shelterchicanimals.

If you think you can give Whitney all the love she deserves and would like to meet her, please go to Petstablished.com or follow the link below to complete an application to adopt. All of our animals are in foster homes. For the sake of our animals and foster families, you must have an approved application with references before you can meet them.

Hey there! Iâm Minerva. FDNY found me wandering around and brought me to Animal Haven so I can find a new home. Theyâre still trying to determine my age, but a lot of people think Iâm somewhere between 2 to 5 years old. Since Iâm really new to the shelter, everyone is still trying to figure me out. I seem to be spooked by things that Iâm not used to and I seem to be always eager to go for a walk. - See more at: https://www.animalhavenshelter.org/adopt/animals/minerva/#sthash.ChWWLSFU.dpuf",38226062,2017-06-02T23:12:01Z,yes,Minerva,Large,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/1/?bust=1496445121&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/1/?bust=1496445121&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/1/?bust=1496445121&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/1/?bust=1496445121&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/1/?bust=1496445121&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/2/?bust=1501693847&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/2/?bust=1501693847&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/2/?bust=1501693847&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/2/?bust=1501693847&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38226062/2/?bust=1501693847&width=50&-t.jpg']",Female,NY17,10013,Altered,Vaccinated,Not housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs

Hi everyone! Iâm Rumple and I am a chill older dude looking for a quiet home to relax in. I was found wandering the streets of NYC with no collar or tags. I was brought to the city shelter but when no one claimed me, Animal Haven decided to take me into their care.

Although I may look âtoughâ with my home-cropped ears, I am really just a gentle giant in need of love. 

 volunteer writes:
Despite his tough looks, scars, and home-cropped ears, Rumple is a gentle, affectionate sweetheart. He is a short, squatty, 9 year old, 70 pound bundle of love. If you sit down next to him, he will give you a kiss, lay his head in your lap and fall asleep. Basically, heâs just a low-key couch-potato, who loves kissing, cuddling, snoozing, snacks, and short walks. Heâs been in the shelter a very long time and needs a home!",39014935,2017-08-07T14:07:46Z,no,Rumple,Large,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/1/?bust=1502114935&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/1/?bust=1502114935&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/1/?bust=1502114935&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/1/?bust=1502114935&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/1/?bust=1502114935&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/2/?bust=1502114972&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/2/?bust=1502114972&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/2/?bust=1502114972&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/2/?bust=1502114972&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/2/?bust=1502114972&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/3/?bust=1502114985&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/3/?bust=1502114985&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/3/?bust=1502114985&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/3/?bust=1502114985&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39014935/3/?bust=1502114985&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY17,10013,Altered,Not vaccinated,Not housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Felinephobic,No special needs

My name is âWalter Pickle Pantsâ and I am one of the most special, spunky, and gregarious cats you will EVER meet. Animal Haven pulled me from the city shelter, where I had been brought in as a stray. Itâs hard to believe that I had been outdoors fending for myself since I am SUCH a people-friendly cat and was also born with Cerebellar Hypoplasia, a neurological condition in which the cerebellum is smaller than usual or not completely developed. But this only makes me THAT much more charming and charismatic. When I walk around, I look like Iâve had way too much tequila. But as far as I know, I am just like any other cat and donât feel any different.
I get along well with small dogs but would prefer to be the only cat. My ideal home family have someone home most the day since I crave lots of attention!

Hi everyone! I was found in a building in Puerto Rico after it was abandoned due to Hurricane Maria. I was left in a crate with minimal food and no water for days! As you mightâve noticed, I am suffering from an environmental fungus that had gone untreated for some time and Iâm currently waiting for a vet visit to see what they can do to accelerate the treatment. Otherwise, Iâm a very sweet quiet girl, excellent walker on leash! I mostly stay by the person walking me.

Hi Iâm Noelle. A good Samaritan saw me being physically abused and managed to take me away to a better life. Iâm currently at the shelter finding lots and lots of attention by our volunteers and staff. I LOVE getting attention apparently. Because Iâve never received this kind of affection before, I donât understand yet that while I love to jump on people say hi, some people might not like that.

I am currently in foster care and here is what my foster mom has to say about me:

Meet my new foster, Pani! Pani is a year old and arrived in New York City just [recently] from Iran (yes, Iran!). She was terribly abused and because of that she is now partially paralyzed. Sheâs only been in my care for [a short time], but I can already tell you she is an angel. I love her already! Iâve fostered special needs dogs before, but sheâs my first paralyzed dog. Iâm still learning things like how to put diapers on a dog, and sheâs still learning about getting around with only two working legs, but together I think weâre both going to learn a lot! The great news is that she has some movement in her hind legs and her tail, so we are really hopeful that some of this damage can be reversed. [She already has appointments lined up to see specialist and start water therapy. For now sheâs resting comfortably in my home and learning that sheâs safe and we wonât let anyone hurt her ever again. ?? For more photos and videos, follow @tedisarah on IG.

Hey everyone, Iâm Ari. When I first arrived at Animal Haven I had a broken leg. No one is quite sure how it happened but it was painful and I was pretty scared. Now Iâm all healed up and get around just fine!

Personality wise, Iâm a sensitive guy and a bit shy at first, but once I get to know you I open up enjoy a good chin scratch and get my purr motor running. I love the company of other cats, and help comfort new shy kitties that enter my room. Iâm even gentle with kittens. Yep, Iâm a pretty awesome boy that just needs to find a loving forever home. Meet me at Animal Haven today!

He might greet you with a growl - actually he growls regularly - but it is his way of speaking.  He doesn't seem to understand that growling is usually a negative behavior.

""Hello, everyone! My name is TONY. I am a 4 year old, 53 pound Pit/Boxer mix.

I was already past due to be put down at a kill-shelter in New York City, when I was miraculously saved by a rescue because of a kind lady who offered to foster me. 

I completed a 6 week training class at PetSmart, and even received a diploma! I know sit, stay, lay down, come, wait, crate, drop it, leave it, and take it. I am crate-trained and walk well on a leash. My foster mom says I am VERY smart and that I learn quickly. I have lots of energy, so a home with a good sized yard or a quiet, nearby park would be best. 

Despite what I have been through, people are my favorite! I am a VERY affectionate boy. I love to sit close and snuggle. I love to throw myself over your lap and get my head and ears rubbed. 

Because of my past, I am fearful of stranger dogs, but please donât let that deter you from adding me to your family! At my foster home, there are three other dogs who live there, and although I was afraid of them at first, they no longer scare me and we can live in harmony. It is believed that I do not like cats though, and a home with older children would probably be best because sometimes I get a little excited and like to jump.

I hope to meet you soon!""

Love,
Tony ?

Tony is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.

DARLIN' - A name, a term of endearmentâ¦.so deserved for this sweet 55 lb, 2 year old girl. Surrendered to our care when her person lost their home, Darlin' lost everything too â her person, her home, her safety. Sheâs an amazing dog who is not only housetrained, she heads to the edge of the sidewalk to take care of her business. 

Her leash manners are good; she pulls only when there is a new scent that canât wait to be investigated. Darlin comes with rockstar comments from her former person: sheâs friendly to all people, loves kids, loves baths and will jump into the tub on her own, loves dogs of both genders but prefers males to females, is not a fan of kitties, sleeps on her own bed but will sometimes sneak onto her personâs bed in the middle of the night, loves to jump and give kisses, loves belly rubs, and knows sit (âput it downâ). 

""I loved my time with this sweetheart â she is everything her former owner said and more. Sheâs gorgeous, sweet, playful, snuggly, takes treats gently, has a great smile and gorgeous eyes, is beautifully groomed, loved playing with a plush toy, posed for photos like a pro. Seriously, if you are still reading this and not rushing over to meet her you are missing out on a gem. Darlin' â her name and a very deserved term of endearment, but donât just take my word for itâ¦..see for yourself.""

Darlin is spayed, up to date on shots, and microchipped. This happy, healthy, darling girl DARLIN is ready to meet you! ?

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Border Collie']","Philly, PA - Meet Jesse, a 4 year old 46 lb. Labrador/Border Collie Mix who is house broken, crate trained, neutered, up to date with all the shots, good with other dogs if properly introduced, (never tested with cats, but it will do if requested.)
From Jesse's devoted foster mom:
""Jesse came from the ACC in Manhattan where he was in the list to be destroyed. We are so glad that Jesse was rescued, but Jesse needs a special home where people can give him time to trust and not rush things. Jesse is very sweet, but needs patience and respect for his need to take things slowly. 
Jesse is a very unique dog, his personality is great! He talks to you all the time and if he is bored he will mumble around, like an old man, but he is anything but old! I think he is a lot of fun! Although he does not like to be grabbed (still), Jesse is sweet and likes to cuddle. He is very athletic so he would be a great companion for jogging, running or hiking. He would do excellent in agility. He is good on a leash and knows Sit, Stay, Give Paw, Down and Roll Over! Such a smart boy! 
Jesse would well in a home with children 10 years of age and up.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Western PA Oh, Mr. Sandman bring me a dream, make him the cutest I've ever seen....that's exactly what you'll be singing when you meet our best brindle boy...4 year old Dream. Unfortunately for this sweet boy, someone woke him up from his dream of a forever home and ! boy, it wasn't pretty. Like that bf or gf that tells you they love you but always cancels plans, I just went through a break up with a family that didn't treat me well. When we met, I was a fit and well built 62 lb. boy. Unfortunately they must've been too busy to realize how skinny I was getting and weren't giving me all the love and care I deserve. I was about half the weight I should have been when they took me away from those people.... Luckily my lifesavers at AmsterDog have one of their angels, Tracy, taking care of me and working their magic. My life is a lot different and by different, I mean better! I'm gaining weight and having so much fun with all the animals at Aunt Tracy's house. And now they're all playing Cupid to make sure I find my true love...AKA my forever family. Not to mention they're helping me get my doggy curves back so I look good for them. So forget about chocolates and flowers, a new doggie is the ultimate gift. I'm pottytrained, love other dogs, cool with cats and big kids. I am also an expert cuddler. Also, really good on a leash. Just ask the shelter volunteers, my current super foster and anyone who has ever met me. Also, I am gosh darn adorable! So come and meet me. Let's make our first date one for the books! By the way, I am neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped too. To meet me, contact AmsterDog at 917 689 8414. Thanks for caring about me!

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"**MIDNIGHT** ONCE A BAIT DOG, NOW A LOVE BUG!***
As if this poor little munchkin hasn't been through enough, lovely MIDNIGHT is losing her foster home, evicted by the landlord!  Kearny, New Jersey 07032*** Editor's Note: If my tiny apartment was even ten square feet bigger and not already at pet capacity, you wouldn't be reading this because I would scoop this dream girl up in a second. Hopefully your place is bigger than mine because our newest AmsterDog, Midnight, is absolutely amazing. Pretty as a picture and sweet as a stack of pancakes, Midnight is cuddly, affectionate, housebroken, smart-- we're sensing a theme here. Yes, she is just about perfect but one thing is missing, her forever home. Which she had since she was a puppy but her owner had some human problems that doggies don't understand so they dropped her off at the shelter. Luckily a superhero swooped in to save her and foster her. Now they're on the search for her forever home. Midnight lived with three big dogs, a kid, is not aggressive with her food and loves getting outside for her exercise and saying What's Up to fellow dogs. Midnight likes a proper introduction to other dogs and wants you to know she loves cuddles but is a little shy at first. Midnight has probably seen some stuff but that hasn't stopped her from being a loving little bunny. So stop thinking about it because yes, owning a dog is freaking awesome and yes, if you already own one you are so ready for another. Don't miss out on Midnight! Midnight is a pretty pittie girl rescued from the city shelter on 6/17/17 who was lucky enough to find a doting foster home to take her in and help save her life. Midnight's foster tells us she is a super sweet girl and while she may be a bit shy at first, it didn't take anytime at all for her to be comfortable with her new family. Midnight is up to date on shots, spayed and chipped.

A volunteer writes: I stumbled across Bubâs Match.com ad: âMe: Single, white and grey male, good looking but need a little TLC for my coat. I love to take walks and meet new people. My tail is always wagging, and I love treats and take them gently. Iâm polite with female dogs Iâve met in my temporary home, and havenât yet been paired with a male for playgroup. The best thing about me is that Iâm a super cuddler, happiest when rolling into my person, giving kisses, and generally just being close. Iâm told I have a great smile, and gorgeous, intelligent eyes. Iâm a lover, and looking for my soul mate, so if you think weâre a good match, letâs meet. More marriages were made on Match, so letâs add to the statistics! You: Looking for a white and grey male, good looking, and a super cuddler for a lifetime of love and snuggles.â Volunteer comment: Bub is a doll, and if a sweet, fun loving partner is your ideal four-legged companion, Bub would love to meet you. He loves treats, so will be easy to train with positive reinforcement (treats!!). I fell in love; you will too. Another volunteer writes: Wiggle, wag, wiggle, wagâthatâs the greeting youâll get when you approach Bubâs kennel. Ready to rush out the door to go potty, heâs then ready for some hugs, some play, and some fun. Lively is the hallmark of his personality, with lots of timeout for cuddling. Bub is hoping a fun, active and affectionate family or person is ready to make him theirs. From Bub's devoted Foster Mom: He is all about being a LOVER. He was a total schmooze in PetSmart, while we bought him some new clothes and treats. Such a schmooze, he convinced the lady in line in front of us to open her treats before she paid for them So she could treat him, while he sat so nicely for her. :) This handsome devil is looking for a home, so any of my connected friends, let me know, and please share the heck out him!",39241280,2017-08-28T22:02:13Z,yes,Buster Tige,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/1/?bust=1503957991&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/1/?bust=1503957991&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/1/?bust=1503957991&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/1/?bust=1503957991&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/1/?bust=1503957991&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/2/?bust=1503957991&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/2/?bust=1503957991&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/2/?bust=1503957991&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/2/?bust=1503957991&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/2/?bust=1503957991&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/3/?bust=1503957992&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/3/?bust=1503957992&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/3/?bust=1503957992&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/3/?bust=1503957992&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/3/?bust=1503957992&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/4/?bust=1503958063&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/4/?bust=1503958063&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/4/?bust=1503958063&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/4/?bust=1503958063&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/4/?bust=1503958063&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/5/?bust=1503958063&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/5/?bust=1503958063&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/5/?bust=1503958063&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/5/?bust=1503958063&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39241280/5/?bust=1503958063&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY1100,10280,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Richmond, VA. **** Who's the cutest dumpling on the planet? C A R R I E, that's who! Who's got personality plus? C A R R I E, that's who! Carrie's former owners obviously thought she was pretty enough to be bred over and again, and when she could no longer produce puppies at 10 years old, they dumped her off at the city shelter. Shame on them, but their loss is our gain, because Carrie is a doll! To know her is to love her~ She loves going for an easy walk, is completely housetrained, loves playing with toys, and the bottom line is, she has no idea how to act like the 'senior' she is. Good for her! Carrie has enjoyed her playgroups with both males and females, offering correction when mounted. Atta girl! A treat lover (she didn't get that pleasantly plump figure for no reason), I'll get a quick woof if I'm not fast enough, and her adorable jowls get all jangly. Carrie is the consummate traveler and loves car rides, sleeping in hotels and let's not forget room service! She's an absolute delight who will be the best couch potato ever. After a walk and some play, that is. Carrie is 70 lbs, up to date on shots, chipped and ready to find her forever home. Please contact AmsterDog at 917 689 8414 and thanks for caring about a sweet senior in need!",39920977,2017-11-15T17:45:50Z,yes,Carrie,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/1/?bust=1510768004&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/1/?bust=1510768004&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/1/?bust=1510768004&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/1/?bust=1510768004&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/1/?bust=1510768004&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/2/?bust=1510768008&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/2/?bust=1510768008&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/2/?bust=1510768008&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/2/?bust=1510768008&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/2/?bust=1510768008&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/3/?bust=1510768015&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/3/?bust=1510768015&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/3/?bust=1510768015&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/3/?bust=1510768015&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/3/?bust=1510768015&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/4/?bust=1510768020&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/4/?bust=1510768020&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/4/?bust=1510768020&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/4/?bust=1510768020&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/4/?bust=1510768020&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/5/?bust=1510768025&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/5/?bust=1510768025&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/5/?bust=1510768025&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/5/?bust=1510768025&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/5/?bust=1510768025&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/6/?bust=1510768185&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/6/?bust=1510768185&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/6/?bust=1510768185&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/6/?bust=1510768185&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39920977/6/?bust=1510768185&width=50&-t.jpg']",Female,NY1100,23173,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs
"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Alexandria, VA 22310***** This AmsterDog will have you saying âThank you, thank you very muchâ just like the legendary singer he was named after. Say hello to Elvis, who may not pull off a white sequin jumpsuit the way Mr. Presley did, but is just as handsome and sure to steal your achey breaky heart. Just like The King, Elvis is all about LOVE. He is super kissy, cuddly, snuggly and quality time with his family gets him glowing. While he loves to be the main act, he is great with other friendly dogs but likes a proper introduction. No fangirling too fast. But we can't blame a dog for tryin', because just look at this adorable low rider! Elvis loves long walks and getting out into the world and while heâs sweet as can be, house broken and a great boy in the house he could use some work on his leash pulling. Heâs also SO happy to be out of the shelter heâs working on some separation anxiety when humans leave but getting better every day because his awesome foster family is letting him know heâs safe and that scary shelter is his past and his future is a forever family that will cherish this hunk and all the happiness he brings. Elvis is a man's kinda man, and loves to hang with the guys; give him football, some basketball and popcorn---he's all IN. However, he has been known to entertain the ladies. Itâs clear to say this guy is loving life and can make you laugh just by looking at that amazing mug. So come meet Elvis and heâll having you singing the Kingâs classic, âWise men say, only fools rush in, but I canât help falling in love with you.â We just know it!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"KIRBY 5 yr old Blue Nosed Pittie~Cuddling is his forte, ******Woodbury, CT 06798******An energetic five-year-old, this bright-eyed, floppy-eared sweetheart will still your heart with just one look. With a gorgeous silver coat and a kind, generous attitude, Kirby, fka Crimson, is perfect on the outside and in. He is right there with you on long walks, but, once you get him home, he is perfectly calm. He loves and charms every person he meets (even the vet staff!), wants to give kisses and wiggles to all, and hugs if you like them, and allows all kinds of handling. All he asks for is a soft bed for snuggles, a chew toy, and a human to love. He loves nothing more than to chew his bone or a rubber ball while you sit by his side. Oh, and he gives as much as he gets â giving kisses and getting scratches and belly rubs. Heâs a dogâs dog, a 50 lb. terrier mix who will perfectly fill that dog-sized hole in your heart. He was found in a city shelter and rescued the day he was set to be euthanized. He wasnât in the best shape at first. He had pneumonia, raw paws from tough days alone on the streets of New York, and a skin infection. But his loving foster parents nursed him back to perfect health, and now he is ready for his new life to begin. Perfectly housetrained and healthy, Kirby will be great in a house or small apartment. He has been through a lot in his young life, but heâs all set for his next adventure â a forever home!! Kirby is neutered and fully vetted.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Terrier,"Northfield, Massachusetts. Nine is Divine! It means that at 9 years old, I'm perky, happy, and love to go for walks. But then, I chill and take nice long naps. My foster mom says I checked out fine at the vet & am ready for a fur-ever home. Woo hoo! The ideal adopter knows how to go slow and doesnât have small, active children. I am blind in one eye so quick movements around my head are confusing. If you're in a rush and open the door quickly, I might bump my head. It takes me a little while to warm up but then I'm your best friend, your companion. Your sidekick! I want more walking and playtime than with my original family. Too much alone time makes me chew on my tail sometimes. I whine for a few minutes when you leave me alone but then I settle in and take a nice, long nap. I'm incredibly house-broken but enjoy 3 good potty breaks plus a nice walk. Around the block here in Western Massachusetts is a couple of miles so I like to walk briskly alternating with sniff & piddle for 30-40 minutes. I'm currently 23 lbs, a few lbs over what I should be. My foster mom thinks good food, play, and exercise will take care of that. I don't have a lot of experience with other dogs but I'm well-behaved when I meet them. Mostly I ignore them, especially the boisterous youngster types. I also met a cat and was very curious but the cat hissed & jumped out of the way when I leaned in for a good, long sniff. Do you need a sidekick? Are you a good pet parent? Do you have a great vet like who can check my weight, lumps & bumps, and eyes & ears each year? Then, ask my foster mom about meeting me. Minnie is up to date on shots, spayed, microchipped, housebroken and all ready to meet you! Please consider adopting this sweet senior girl!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Sickersville, NJ *** Two year old Gizmo is a very handsome young man, a red head, quite poised. He has been outstandingly cared for by his former owners, being of perfect weight at 53 lbs and wearing a most beautiful coat. He lived harmoniously with older children, was friendly and outgoing with all, playful with dogs his size (timid with small ones) and very playful. Gizmo is quite sociable, a good walker who seems to like other dogs, gentle, giving standing hugs, happy to be petted and very playful with the ball or a toy. He seems to like to keep them for himself, so we just exchange one toy for another, slipping a treat here and there as a reward for good behavior. I forgot to say that Gizmo is a very good sitter, taking duck jerkies quite politely from my hand. I really like Gizmo, a very good looking young lad, friendly and so playful. If you have the talent or the time to improve his training, Gizmo will make a very nice and loving pet for an active owner. Gizmo is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"**Hyde Park, MA 02136** Valentineâs Day may be a few weeks away but our sweet vanilla and butterscotch Sasha is ready to steal your heart TODAY. Just one look into those baby brown eyes and next thing you know youâre in love. This 6 year old AmsterDog is a pretty little lady with a big heart and even bigger dreams. You see, she was emaciated at 24 lbs. when animal control found her, but she is now all filled out and healthy. At night, when Sasha is sleeping, she dreams of her forever family. She sees herself cuddling with them, reassuring her that she is home because sheâs a smart, sensitive lady that just needs a reminder that âItâs OK!â. She sees herself sneaking naps with her humans when they doze off watching their favorite shows. Sheâs not picky about her choice of TV but we have feeling Sasha is a fan of rom coms. She sees a whole room full of tennis balls (ok maybe just a basket) and playing catch with her family. Sasha loves her naps, but this lady likes her exercise too. Wow, this is one long dream because Sasha also sees just a few furry friends. After all she went through we think she would be better in a home where sheâs one of the few animals or a pretty chill environment. She might be OK with a bigger crew after a while but she is still unwinding from that scary city shelter. Sasha sees giving and getting lots of love from her family and being silly at the same time. Sasha might not see this in her dream, but we had to add that she is occasionally guarding her food slightly.

If you would like to meet this friendly guy, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414. A volunteer writes: One of my all time favorite movies is What About Bob? and if I were to make a version about this Bob, it would have to be Whatâs Not to Love About Bob? He might be middle-aged, but youâd never guess it, and he is cute as can be. He was shy at first with me, but still very easy to handle, and even nerves canât stop his sweetness from shining through. He is easy to walk on leash, seems to have housetraining, and is very treat-motivated (he already knows basic commands, too!). He loves toys, and although he has been nervous around other dogs in our playgroups, he has been very tolerant, and is even used as a greeter dog. He warms up to solicit affection, and is really lovely company! Words from Bobâs foster mom: He's a very happy easy going dog, he reminds me of a golden retriever. He likes to lay out on the floor like a frog, root through his toy box, sit next to his dog friend, and follow any human he sees. He is very smart and knows a lot of commands including agility. He is great and just sits calmly for bath, nails, and ear cleaning! He's always happy and just thinks humans are the greatest! Low energy but if you wanted to play he would def rally and play.

His foster parents write: Bruce likes long walks where he can sniff out pray and enjoys his butt scratched 24 hours a day.

Bruce loves to play but I recommend no indoor playing as he gets very excited and energetic! He is an exuberant love bug and deserves the best home and I hope with some teenage kids that he can run & play with. Even though Bruce is very strong he can be gentle as well and takes treats nice of your hand. Bruce needs time to warm up but is learning to give kisses and loves giving hugs. Bruce is amazing and super duper wonderful and deserves the best home! Bruce is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Shar Pei,"Rockaway Beach, NY***** Happy Chinese New Year! Itâs the Year of the Dog, our favorite! And one AmsterDog in particular is ready to get the party started. Say hello to 5 year old 54 lb. Papo, our sweet, beautiful Sharpei. Or shall we say SharPapo since he is his own breed of cute. Dumplings have crinkles but Papo has wrinkles that make him deliciously adorable. Papoâs ancestry is said to be linked to the Han Dynasty and even go as far back as 206 BC but he is a modern day love bug! Weâre guessing emperors liked to cuddle when they wernât busy ruling the world because Papo is a natural at it and so affectionate, playful and loving. Heâs also a good boy of regal standards when youâre not home, loves spending time with his human friends, will love you even more when he gets his toys and bones and, weâre not sure how far back leashes go but he really know how to strut his stuff on walks, catching everyoneâs eye. Papo has a lot to celebrate in addition to the New Year. We saved him from the shelter where he ended for no fault of his own and then had to have surgery on his eyelids. But now, heâs recovering great because heâs so excited every time we tell him about his place called Forever Home. We canât say enough about this guy, probably because we are obsessed with how cute his wrinkles are. But what we can tell you, is that Papo would give up the parades, fireworks, and even cake to know he is finally home and loved. That sounds like the best celebration of all. ***** To learn more about Papo, please contact AmsterDog at 917 689 8414, email amsterdog@gmail.com, or PM us here on Facebook. Thank you for caring about a pet in need!

Cuddling is his forte and so is sitting for treats:) Jack is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. If you would like to meet this sweet boy, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414. Thank you ?? Volunteer writes: Jackie joined us with a large wound to his back leg, requiring immediate care to clean and suture it. Heâs quiet in his kennel, and as I opened his door his tail wagged a hello. Stepping out carefully weâre out the door and Jackieâs first priority is going potty. We donât walk far as I donât want to hurt his leg so we spent time petting, enjoying treats and sweet talk. As gentle as a lamb describes Jackie at this point during which must be such an uncomfortable and confusing time. Medical staff tells me what a nice dog heâs been during treatments and he certainly is. âSweet and friendlyâ is how theyâve described him and Iâd say that fits him perfectly. Heâs also a bit underweight, and despite that took my offered treats so gently. Like people, dogs recuperate and heal more quickly in a home environment and weâd love for Jackie to find his healing place quickly. Heâs a sweetheart who responds so well to love, and is ready to share it with his new person.

Queens, NY - ****Update: 12/3/17**** Freddy is now staying at a vet hospital while we look for a foster home for him. Here is what his advocate and sponsor had to say about him : ""I managed to arrive a couple of minutes before Mathew brought Frodo in. He immediately made himself at home: jumping at everybody and kissing everybody. He is extremely outgoing, friendly and sweet dog. He came with scratched nose and sides of lips. I could lift him, hold him, put ointment on the scratches. He is very young and has a lot of energy of course. Thus I had to steady him by holding his muzzle to put ointment on â no problem at all. His accommodations are very good: the hospital is very warm, he has separate room with huge crate (good enough for a Great Dane), I provided two comforters, two soft wide collers, two leashes, a sweater and a coat. There are other animals in the hospital overnight too. I walked him longer than an hour yesterday night and today morning. We will continue this schedule of walking. I am taking it easy: he learned âwaitâ quickly so I can pick his poop up and let cars and people pass (not so many in this area). Making him walk together with me will be of course harder job. I do not request for dogs to truly heal but they should not ever be in front or in back of me â we should walk together side by side with them sniffing and etc. I will have pictures taken during the week-end: too much going on now. There is a possibility of foster round the corner from me. But I am taking everything one step at a time. The hospital personnel is very compassionate and experienced with rescue. They loved him from the first sight. They will take good care of him for now. I think he will get a lot of attention and will be much happier there. He is very small and I think he is a pedigree: a true pit with stance and body type â just miniature. I have seen some like that: the owners told me that they are called âBulli pitsâ. I will check it out."" Stay tuned for more on Freddy Frodo! A volunteer writes: Hello up there, new human friend! My nameâs Frodo, this is my chew toy, and weâre on the hunt for an adventureâ¦wanna come with me? Iâm a lot like that other Frodo you know, pint-sized, innocent and true of heart, I even have furry feet like him! My whole outlook on life is can-do and I donât have a beef with anyone. See how I meet passing people and dogs with tail wags and a wigglebutt? Thatâs just me being me, I am full of love! Iâm also full of energy and nothing makes me happier than getting my zoomie on in the yard, playing fetch or just running around with my peeps. I never guard my things, though I play a pretty good game of tug-o-war, and I always keep my mouth what they call âsoftâ so no one gets hurtânot even the toys! Cuddles are cool too and if you try to kiss me, guess what? Iâm gonna kiss you right back. So whaddya say? You, me, my chew toy and endless adventures full of snuggles and fun?

You can believe me when I tell you that his album photos do him no justice. This chap is even better looking in person! But rest assured her is not just a pretty face! He is very smart and has such a nice temperament. Haven adores people and children and would like to spend every moment with you (not in a clingy way!) He is quite the athlete and loves all sports - hiking, fetch, run, you name it. Our supermodel likes other dogs and gets along with kitties too! Hurry to meet him at the Westchester Canine Center. He is a gem! Haven is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. If you would like to meet this handsome fella, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414. ?? A volunteer writes: Haven lets you know that he does not belong to a kennel. He enjoys being with people. He loves to play ball or run in the park. He is quite a handsome and athletic young dog and very pleasant to spend time with. He is a great walker(I was so wrong thinking that he could be a major puller), not a bird or squirrel chaser and although interested, he is respectful of other pooches met on the way. He seems to be house trained, of course. Haven is a little anxious(he has gotten better) and spending his energy at fetching and retrieving balls in the yard is right up his alley. I like that he brings back the ball right at my feet, lets me pick it up and waits for the throw. He can jump very high and even twirl in the air. Haven samples treats politely , sits on command and even gives paw. He might be a big and strong guy but he does know that he can find comfort and love in his caretaker, accepting caresses and hugs.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"SCULLY (now Rosie) - 3 years old, 62 lbs, Waxhaw, NC My name used to be Scully but my foster mama calls me Rosie. I am currently being fostered in NC after being surrendered to a kill shelter in December, right before Christmas no less. I'm a boxer pittie mix and am almost three years old. My ideal home would be with an active person/couple as I have lots of energy. If you have a fenced in backyard even better! I love, love, love to run and play but still need to learn to come back to you. Off leash is a no no without a fence. I adore long walks and light hiking. I can probably be trained for longer hikes and to go on a morning run with you! I have allergies to chicken and fleas and am on a special diet and medication presently. My foster mom is transitioning me to a limited ingredient commercial diet. Seems to be working fine and my allergies are in check. I'm am so easy peasy to medicate - you can drop it on top of my food or give it to me rolled in cheese. I LOVE cheese. Really, I do. Oh, I also love organic apples, baby carrots and bananas. My foster mom gives me these as treats. Unfortunately I am not a cat lover so a home with NO CATS is required. I am iffy with other dogs. Some I like. Some I don't. I am the girl boss after all. I would LOVE to be your one and only. I was surrendered from a home with small children, one small dog and two ferrets because the landlord said I had to go. I do have a loud bark. Maybe it was that? I'm shy at first and need a week or two to settle in. And for some reason I am a lap dog. Or, at least I think I should be. I have the most soulful eyes and give lots of kisses. I can shake and am decent on a leash, regular and retractable. A volunteer writes: Scully. Without her Mulder? Looking up for UFOâs? Maybe. Miss Scully started off as scared in her kennel, as this isnât what she knows. She knows her former family of 2 adults, 2 young children and 2 ferrets, her soft bed, a full food bowl (sheâs allergic to chicken), and covers to hide under if thereâs a thunder storm. Scully is finally persuaded that Iâm a friend, and once out, goes potty (weâre told sheâs housetrained), shows me nice leash manners, and then off leash in the back joins me on the bench for some petting. Pleasantly plump, sheâs been fed with love, her coat clean and groomed. Scully enjoys treats, taking them gently, gives kisses through the fence at a dog in an adjoining pen, and while still a bit anxious at this upheaval in her life, is making friends and coming out of her shell. Weâre told she can be shy with strangers at first, and weâre all strangers, so this is a lot for this beautiful girl to deal with. And sheâs dealing just fine, figuring it out step by step. I donât do change well either, so I get Miss Scully and how brave sheâs being. Scully is a proven family girl, and even liked licking the ferrets, so letâs get this little girl into a new home so she can once again have a family to love and take care of. A volunteer updates: Thatâs my girl! Scully saw me approach, her tail starts to wag and she came forward to be leashed. (She licked the ferrets she lived with, I still love that about her!) Sheâs figured out the routine, knows that people with leashes are friends ready to take her out for a walk and sheâs a happy girl. Off leash, some zoomies, some bounces, some tail wags and a big smile; sheâs happy to be out to stretch her legs and go potty. Sheâs such a beautiful dog, she takes my breath away as I watch her scamper through the pen. Sheâs ready to be part of a loving family again, and all she needs is for you to meet her and say âsheâs the oneâ, and take her home. Youâll want to, trust me.

Ivy is available for adoption! 

Spring has sprung! The roses, tulips and magnolia are all about to bloom but we're really excited about Ivy, our gorgeous, goofy, grey and white girl. We think Ivy must be part love bug because she is soooooo sweet and people are her favorite thing in this world. Like maybe even more than treats and bones. 

While Ivy's got a 24/7 grin now we rescued her right in time from a shelter that doesn't make any dog smile when they think about it. But thank goodness we did because she's dreaming of her forever home where she gets to give her humans tons of love and get lots of loving right back. We think Ivy would be best as the only dog in the house for now. And while spring flings sound fun, Ivy's love doesn't just last all year round but forever in fact.  So come meet amazing Ivy today. 

Ivy is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. If you would like to meet Ivy, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414.

She has plenty of spunk and likes to check out whats going on around the house but mostly she just loves being loved!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"We can learn a lot from dogs. Winter in particular. This 2 year old amazing pup was rescued from a horrendous situation in the Bronx where she was starved and neglected by the people who had her. Additionally, she was tethered most of the day. She rail thin and in dire need need of medical care. Hard to imagine how anyone could do this do a dog, but it happens all too frequently. 

But Winter has moved on completely. She is a wonderful, chill dog who loves the company of people and dogs alike.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noDogs']",Adult,Dog,"['Pit Bull Terrier', 'Hound']","Sweet Haze is the kind of dog who is a little shy at first, but once he knows you, you've got a friend for life. He was a family dog who was surrendered to the city shelter because his caretaker became ill and could no longer care for him. So, after living his whole 7 years with one family he wound up in strange surroundings. But the volunteers fell for him writing:

We volunteers were talking about Haze and agreed that he was such a pleasant dog to walk and spend time with. He is cute, too, medium sized, so silky, well groomed, well nourished and dressed a bit like a chipmunk. Haze is a gently mannered dog who is with us as his ailing owner could not care for a pet anymore. Haze is a good walker and minds his business with birds, squirrels, and other dogs. He is obedient, comes when called, sits on command and hops with help on the bench for cuddles. Haze was a bit hesitant at the beginning of our encounter, but a few minutes into our time together, the ice was broken. 

Haze needs a loving patient home who can earn his confidence which will yield undying love and cuddles. He deserves a second chance. Could it be with you?

Kevin is a 1.5 yr old lab/boxer mix and is full of love. He was pulled him from the euthanasia list within minutes of his âtimeâ. He is a sweetheart and loves to play. Kevin is so excited to play that he loses all of his manners while doing so. His new home needs to be with someone who can work with him on his manners. He loves walks, he loves to be held as he does feel he is a lap dog. He does not seem to mind that he is 60 lbsâ¦he thinks he is fine in your lap or near it. He is a big baby. He will need a fenced in yard. He is of course neutered and utd on all shots. Kevin has been Pattyâs best friend since he met her. It seems Patty was abused. She is very very shy and the sweetest girl and so gentle. She is afraid of most men. It has taken her a long time to come out of her shell but she now wags her tail and smiles a bit, Kevin is her anchor. When she saw Kevin for the first time- she was eager to meet him and he has helped her with so many of her fears. They are so good together, now they run and play all the time Patty is so comfortable around him. They really really should be adopted together. We are hoping for a home for the two of them with a yard so they can run and play.

"['altered', 'housetrained']",Adult,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"Timothy Bob and Oscar are in need of a home- they all get along with other cats, dogs, and they love their people. They are all fixed and utd on their shots. These boys just need a new place to hang out. They are all low maintenance- they came from a senior who was sick and whose home unfortunately we not fit for human nor animal to live. They are very happy to just ""be"" cats.

Timothy(light orange with cinnamon nose) is about 6 - 8 yrs old. He is just a love - sweet, friendly, vocal. He LOVES people. He enjoys playing with his toys and being brushed. He is Super super sweet; very playful. Loves to chase the kitty âbirdiesâ and thoroughly enjoys being pet. He comes running at you - tail high - to get his morning hellos

Bob (grey) is about 10- 12 yrs old He is just the sweetest most friendly cat and loves attention and enjoys a good conversation and kisses on the head. He also loves to head butt his human :). Loves to be pet and brushed. He feels teeth are overrated, hence he has none. Loves to sleep on chairs, he feels cat beds are too small for him! Just sweet beyond belief.

Oscar is about 7-9 yrs old. He is a bit more subdued. Sweet and quiet. He sometimes does his own thing but loves hanging with his buddy Bob. He is people friendly but a little more aloof. Heâs got spunk, loves to play with kitty toys. Meows but no sound comes out:0 and sometimes he has a little cattitude but he still looks for affection and enjoys being pet.

Here are 3 loving boys that need you.

"['altered', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,"['Chinese Crested Dog', 'Terrier']","Meet Jenny and Missy

They were pulled from local shelter where they found themselves brought in as âstraysâ . They seem to be mother daughter or sisters we are unsure but are bonded. Both are very very sweet.

Jenny is about 10ish and is both visually and hearing impaired. She has some arthritic issues as well but is very content walking around the yard a bit and laying in the sun. She seems to be a Chinese crested powder puff., a very sweet little girl.

Missy is younger- maybe 8 or so; she is a bit more active than Jenny but again, very very sweet. She too enjoys her time in the yard and enjoys spending time with Jenny. She is a bit more playful than Jenny. Both are as sweet as can be. She is a mix. Missy will be having her eye removed next week.

They are bonded and cannot be separated. They would do best with someone home during the day who can give them the TLC they deserve at this point in their lives. Neither of them like the camera!!

They would do best with a yard.

altered,Adult,Dog,Lhasa Apso,"Huey is a male, neutered Llhasa Apso who approximately 10-12 years old. He was pulled him from a local shelter back in April of this year; his senior owner passed away.

He came to us blind in his left eye and recently had surgery to remove the eye as it had unexpectedly ruptured.

This little guy is so looking to be loved and is wonderful with everyone â kids, cats and other dogs. He would be a wonderful addition to any home but we feel young children and young dogs would not be the best fit.

A nice home where he can relax and be comfortable, a back yard to do some sun bathing and maybe an occasional walk.

The perfect home would be a retired person or couple that is looking for a sweet calm companion who enjoys car rides. He is so ready for his new home and his new best friend to care for him as he so deserves. He is pictured before and after surgery.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'noKids']",Senior,Dog,Chihuahua,"Meet Fern! Fern is a 10 year old, 8lb spayed Chihuahua.

Fern is a chill, quiet little pup that loves dogs (especially other Chihuahuas) and amazingly, she loves cats! Fern was in a high kill shelter for almost 2 months then went to our longtime trusted foster but had no luck finding her forever home. Now she's got a new foster mom who has been gentle and gave her some time adjusting. Here's what she has to say about our senior girlfriend: 

- I would say her mood is ''silly"" (in a cute way!). 

- She jumps and wags her tail a lot and it's ""party time"" when i get home 

- Sometimes she talks back to me (in a cute way), and i really think she believes she is speaking ''human'' 

- She is quite energetic for her age and loves to play ""running up and down the long hallway.'' 

- She is stand-off (ish) at first, though within the past week has become more affectionate and will sit in my lap and allow me to hold her. 

- Sometimes she will sleep in the bed with me, but other times she prefers to sleep in the dog bed next to my bed. 

- She follows me everywhere in the house, like a little shadow. 

- She is GREAT with the cat! 

- Loves vegetables and fruits- even green peppers

-Uses the wee wee pad (most of the time!)

Fern will do best in an enviroment with no children, since she requires some handling experience. If you think you can offer her a fantastic environment in her golden years, we urge you to apply!

Fern was rescued in LA as part of our Waggy West rescue mission to bring At Risk dogs, one by one to NYC for adoption! We are always looking for volunteer chaperones to bring at risk dogs like her with them on their next LA-NYC flight, we pay the dog's ticket and provide a carrier! Email waggytailwest@gmail.com if you can help!

Please contact us DIRECTLY using the instructions below if you are interested in fostering or adopting one of our Waggytails! Visit our website (www.waggytailrescue.org) for an adoption or foster application on the CONTACT US page.

PLEASE NOTE: Dogs marked ""Adoption Pending"" have an approved adoption application on file and are awaiting final approval. Please check back in a few days to see if they are still available!

Jerry might take a while to warm up to new people, but once he does he loves his belly rubs and being pet! He enjoys going on walks and is well behaved on the leash. 

Jerry has some issues resource guarding toys so we would recommend that he not be allowed to have them, with gradual introduction with positive reinforcement that it's good to share. He is treat motivated so he think with work she should be able to overcome this. We would recommend an all adult home with experienced adopters willing to give him the time and attention he deserves!

Jerry is up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered. He has also had a dental cleaning.

Daisy is very sweet. She is easy to handle and loves to be close to her humans, she is a big cuddle bug and lives for belly rubs! Daisy walks well on leash and would love to have an active owner! Sheâd be an excellent companion to explore the city with, and she's mini enough to stick in your bag and go! Daisy gets along with most other dogs but sheâs not fond of cats. She is house-broken to go outside, yet knows how to use wee-wee pads if she has to. 

Daisy sometimes resource gaurds her food, but this is a behavior that can be easily modified with positive training methods and a bit of patience! She is living happily with two other small dogs. 

Daisy is up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed. 

Daisy was rescued in LA as part of our Waggy West rescue mission to bring At Risk dogs, one by one to NYC for adoption!

Ladybug is a female Chi-ler (#chihuahua/#Heeler mix). She is about 1-2 years old and 20lb. She is shy but once she gets some gentle love and affection she warms up and is affectionate. She is small and adorable, up to date on shots, spayed and chipped. She seems to be ok around cats, and housebroken as long as she's on a schedule. She does not like staying in a crate! She is playful, but not with toys. She'd rather play with clothes (a girlie girl). Let's get her adopted so she can be dressed up and prance around and show her beautiful self off.

hasShots,Adult,Dog,"['Chihuahua', 'Miniature Pinscher']","Diamond is a 5-6 year old, 6.8 pound spayed female Chihuahua / Mini Pincher! Just look at her petite frame and sweet chestnut eyes. She is looking for her forever home in NYC as she just flew here to the big apple from Los Angeles.

Diamond is incredibly sweet with sultry eyes. Everyone who meets her falls in love with how quickly she snuggles up in your arms. She is very much a lady when it comes to everything she does. She adapts to any situation from cuddling in her bed, to going out shopping and even subways. She is always eager to go on car rides and sits patiently in her car seat throughout the ride. Sheâs a shy dame because she was recently surrendered to the shelter, so she needs a little TLC and has a little separation anxiety because she is heartbroken. She does well with other dogs and doesnât shy away from children. She is house-broken to go outside. She is quiet and a non-barker, but at times does whine when her human is not near. She is learning to find comfort in being alone and peanut butter is definitely her comfort food. 

Diamond gets along with dogs and cats.

Diamond is up to date on shots and microchipped. She is scheduled to be spayed July 12th.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Senior,Dog,Chihuahua,"Chico is a 12 year old, 8lb Chihuahua mix. Our fabulous senior looking for his forever home!

He would be the perfect addition to a home that already has a fur baby. He gets along with everyone he comes across. He is a big fan of being pet... Forget to give him a nice scratch behind the ears?? Donât worry... Chico will not hesitate to remind you that scratches are to be had. Chico also enjoys getting a good belly rub.

His fosters are currently working on basic commands, but Chico has shown an affinity to spinning when he knows there is a treat waiting. He enjoys going on walks: at least four a day. He has a very healthy appetite, so we ensure that he gets his kibble in smaller, more frequent meals. He is quiet and mellow, medium to low energy.

Chico is up to date on shots, chipped, neutered and just had his dental done recently.

No additional info,Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Sweetie Pie is a 5 year old chihuahua. Sweetie Pie is small and a perfectly-sized dog for an apartment. Chihuahuas are total snuggle-bugs and love to burrow under blankets and sheets and are amazing companions. Sweetie Pie is currently in a foster home who says she is just the cutest! As for humans, she is the perfect companion animal. She cuddles, sheâs great in the car and in a bag, sheâs not a huge barker and sheâs super soft and funny and will follow you around. Sheâs really loveable and adorable and at 10lbs, sheâs fully portable. Sheâs great with all people, including children but should be an only dog, because although she has been fostered with multiple dogs and a cat, she would prefer not to be.

She is up to date on shots, HW negative and is spayed. (See note in ""The small print"" here: https://www.waggytailrescue.org/adopt-a-waggytail)

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Jerry Stiller is a 7 year old, 7 lb Chihuahua!

This little guy is a bit timid, he wants to be loved and warms up more quickly to men. That said he is his foster mom's little shadow and likes to fllow her around the apartment checking up on what she's doing, and is gentely asking to be pet now he has built up some trust! Jerry has lived with another dog before and we would love for him to be adopted into a home with another pup who can show him the doggy ropes. He has also spent some time around children and was fine around calm kids.

Jerry is currently polishing up his potty training and is doing well using pee pads when he is kept in a small space to do his business.

Jerry came to us as an owner surrender in Los Angeles from what may have been a breeding/hoarding situation. With love, patience and a doggy sidekick we hope he will blossom into a sweet and loving companion!

Jerry is up to date on shots, chipped and neutered. He had a dental cleaning in Los Angeles before he flew to NYC where he is now looking for his forever people!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Charlie is a 6 year old, 6lb neutered male Chihuahua! He is up-to-date on shots and microchipped.

Charlie is a total love bug. This little guy loves people, other dogs, and even cats. He is very quiet (never barks) and his foster reports that the only time she has heard him make a noise was when he was woofing in his sleep! Charlie follows his human everywhere, and his favorite thing to do is be close to his person. If you're looking for a sweet little shadow, look no further. 

 At the moment he is eating a special veterinary diet that will help him with his digestive system. He had some unexpected health issues, and he is on the mend and we are looking for an adopter who will carefully keep to a strict diet and potty routine. All this little pup wants is a warm lap and a relaxed, loving home! Please ask about this for more information. 

Charlie should go to a home with another friendly dog. He loves being around dogs and he loves to snuggle. He gets along with cats and children, too! Charlie is currently fostered with two senior chihuahuas and fits right into the pack. He will be the perfect addition to your home (and pack!)

Charlie was rescued in LA as part of our Waggy West rescue mission to bring At Risk dogs, one by one to NYC for adoption! We are always looking for volunteer chaperones to bring at risk dogs like him with them on their next LA-NYC flight, we pay the dog's ticket and provide a carrier!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Meet Leon!

Leon is a 5 year old, 7lb neutered male Chihuahua.

Leon is an adorable chunky pup that loves to sleep! He is very quiet, potty trained to go outside, and overall low engery dog. He is good with other dogs and cats (his foster home has 2 small dogs and 2 cats) and he fit in just fine. This little guy is scared easily, so it is best to gently approach him when being handled to ensure he doesn't ""air snap"" out of fear. Leon rarely barks, travles great in a carrier, and will be a great addition to any family with no small children (due to his size and fear).

Leon was rescued in LA as part of our Waggy West rescue mission to bring At Risk dogs, one by one to NYC for adoption! We are always looking for volunteer chaperones to bring at risk dogs like him with them on their next LA-NYC flight, we pay the dog's ticket and provide a carrier!

He's a happy loverboy who gives a lot of kisses and is happy to snuggle in your lap. We think he's about 7 lbs, so he's a perfect apartment dog. He is listed as being 1.5 but his foster thinks he's younger since his teeth are so white and his energy is so bright! He gets along great with his foster dog and cat siblings, and has an energetic classic puppy personality. He loves to play with toys and loves to cuddle, and falls asleep as soon as you lay him on his back haha! He wants plenty of love and attention, and we think he would be an amazing choice for someone looking for a family pet.

He is up to date on shots and has just been neutered.

Ty, true to his breed, is go! go! go! He loves to run and play fetch, and to have a good romp with other dogs. He is ideally looking for a home that will give him the exercise he needs to burn off all that cattle dog energy! Ty is a smart pup, he knows his name and is learning basic obedience in his foster home.

Ty would make a great family pet for an active household. He has lived with kids and other dogs and gets on well with them. He takes his lead from opther pups so we would love if he could find a home with a furry sibling. He walks well on his leash and is housebroken.

Ty is up to date on shots, microchipped and neutered!

Toby has previously lived with older children (10 years plus) and was relaxed around them, however think he would do best in an adult home as small kids make him nervous and defensive.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,"How is it possible that only recently, the exuberant, beautiful Zoey, abandoned by her owner at a high kill shelter, was leaning against the legs of volunteers because she was too weak to stand on her own? Utterly disoriented that after her 1 year old life in the comfort of a home, she was suddenly on her own, facing certain death? Now, rescued into a foster home and fully recovered, she runs and leaps and bounds and jumps into the air as if the air were itself a playmate. She spreads kisses among humans and dogs as Jackson Pollack scattered paint, wildly and beautifully. She loves dogs, she loves people, she loves butterflies, she loves blades of grass...this beautiful spotted Brindle girl is in love with it all, in love with love. In the shelter, she was so depressed we were concerned about her survival; we are equally and utterly convinced that now, she knows she has been given a second lease on life, and she isn't missing a second of it. The only thing that Zoey IS still missing is constant and dependable, forever companionship, with another human, and perhaps another animal...she isn't picky. But she is a wonderful dog who craves a place to belong, a person and/or animal to pay attention to, to play with, with whom to play. We have given Zoey a chance at another life. Please  give this glorious pup, who is overflowing with delight and love and goodness, a chance to share her love with others.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Terrier,"Here's how extraordinary this 6 year-old family dog is: One of her caretakers in the high kill shelter where she was surrendered tried to adopt her but ultimately wasn't able to because of housing issues. Needless to say, these kennel officers see dogs day in and day out, so to be so moved by a resident as to try to adopt her means a dog is spectacular. And Treasure is exactly that--an unbelievable find! She formerly lived with and loved a cat as well as a dog, she adores playing with animals and humans of all sizes, showing notable gentleness around children. She is house trained, loves to share her toys, enjoys her bath, doesn't mind getting a mani/pedi, and knows how to ""sit"" and ""come."" But her favorite, favorite pastimes are getting her belly rubbed and hanging out with her family, two things she doesn't have much of a chance to indulge in while she is in foster care, awaiting her forever home. It's hard to know who will be luckier when you all unite, your family or Treasure, but we would be so delighted to call it a win/win! Please, don't make this girl wait another moment for a lifetime of tummy rubs and romping!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"âGorgeous Rebecca waited patiently in her kennel, came forward to be leashed and stepped quietly out for a walk.  Going potty as soon as we were out the door tells me she's housetrained, and she looked up at me waiting for her ""good girl"" and a ""good girl"" treat which of course she got!  She's fabulous on leash and I thoroughly enjoyed my walk with her - it was definitely saving the best for last.  A small yappy dog pulled towards us and Rebecca graciously ignored him, looking up at me as if to say - cute guy but noisy, huh?!  In her first group Rebecca greeted the helper dog appropriately and then wandered off to explore the pen.   She happily greeted another dog through the fence, clearly wanting to meet and play.  Rebecca is unique and gorgeous - her long, elegant, slim neck calls out to be a neckpiece model, and her cute little ears frame her eyes which are intelligent, soft and speak of a gentle nature.  She gets playfully silly and bouncy for a moment, and then joins me on the bench for some petting and kisses.  Rebecca was scared during her behavior assessment, especially during the tag portion.  I pet and tapped her all over and had no issues with her.  She'll need a quiet, gentle approach, a soft voice and easy hand and is ready to prove to you what an awesome companion she can be.  I fell in love with her, she has my heart, and know that you will too.

Cookie came into the shelter after her owner moved away and left her outside. Thankfully, the neighbors call the shelter to come pick her up. Cookie waited for her chance at a forever home for over THREE LONG YEARS inside the shelter walls, until see finally made it to her foster home. It breaks our hearts that she was over looked for so long, but we feel her luck changing! Cookie is 100% house broken, and crate trained. Cookie loves to be the mommy to puppies and kittens who she has met over the years. Cookie will need very slow, and proper introductions to other dogs, and she would much prefer males. We are recommending Cookie not go home with children, as as she is wary of strangers. It takes time for people to gain Cookie's trust, but once you do, she becomes a MUSH of a dog. Please consider opening your home to the girl who has been over looked for her entire life.

Elvis is a friendly house cat that I found abandoned in a desolate area during January's record blizzard.

Elvis is distinctive in that --Not only is he a laid back cat he does not scratch furniture or cat scratchers!!!!!

He is a big teddy bear. He loves to be picked up and hugged, and purrs loudly. The vet estimates his age between 5-9 years old.
He is a super gentle and laid back cat. When I found him I jumped out of the car and picked him right up. He calmly sat in my arms on the way home. Despite his awful abandonment, he is friendly and has a heart of gold. He loves to be petted and purrs strongly. He is currently living with other cats but would rather be a Solo cat. Elvis is a mellow fellow and super low maintenance --he has excellent litter box habits and is not a fussy eater. He is healthy and tests negative to FIV/ FeLV. Elvis was found neutered and has all his vaccines. If you would like to meet him, in Brooklyn, Manhattan, or Staten Island please contact jensenmania@gmail.com.
There is a small adoption fee to cover vetting, and an adoption application.

No additional info,Adult,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"Soft, gentle lap cat seeking long term relationship with cuddly human. My name is Marley and I am tired of an endless series of casual meetings with strangers. I am ready to settle down in a stable, forever home and devote myself to one or two good people.

I am five years old and have been through some upheavals, lately. Born in an outdoor feral cat colony in Ditmas Park and rescued as a kitten, I was recently left by my owner of five years. I was somewhat traumatized when I landed at Brooklyn Cat Cafe, but after some time hanging out UNDER the couches I discovered it was cooler to hang out ON the couches and meet people. It turned out to be even cooler to sit in their laps (including Santa's!) Boy, do I like to snuggle up to somebody and get some lovin! I am starting to get a bit of a paunch and if you make a point of it, I might even get into some cat toys for a little exercise now and then.

Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with all those annoying other cats at the Cat Cafe, so I went to a foster, who then had to travel. I am trying things out with another nice lady, but she won't commit. So if you're ready for a sweet, devoted, faithful companion, give me a call!

I also having amazing jumping abilities â probably from the part Bengal in me â and can pull down any wand toy, no matter how high you swing it!I am 3 1/2 years old. About 2 years ago, I was dumped at the NYC Animal Care & Control in Manhattan and was almost immediately placed on that dreaded list. I am not sure why, but think it was because I came down with a respiratory infection. Thankfully, Big Hands Little Paws rescued me, helped me feel better, and even got me neutered (yikes!) and micro-chipped.I also have been having lots of my fun with my foster family, which includes a house full of humans and other cats, but I really, really want to find a forever family.

Sometimes I have trouble telling the difference between play and prey so I think I would do best as an only cat and probably not with children. The members at BHLP think I would do best with an experienced cat parent. Iâm cool with that since I want someone who can teach and show me a few new things. And, I am a quick learner: I know how to sit for treats (hint! hint!). I am FIV/FELV negative, neutered and micro-chipped, and am all ready to âjumpâ into your armsâ¦

Please catch me and take me home?

Simone gets around, but needs a very, very low litter box. She would probably do best with a wee wee pad holder rather than a box to get into. She sometimes acts out a bit and uses something strewn on the floor instead of her box.  Otherwise, she's like any other cat--just more adorable and laudable for her efforts to be a typical cat.  She  has a condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia, which is a neurological condition resulting from a pre-natal infection.  It does no impair her health or longevity, but it does make her cuter than you can imagine.  She wobbles and tumbles at times, but she's just fine that way--she thinks it's normal.

Charlie previously had some personality quirks that were puzzling.  We have fixed that with a little pill daily--prozac!  Generic, of course, it is the savior of many cats who are total mushes but have unpredictable moments.

Charlie is now completely predictable, and the predictions are all good.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Cat,Tabby,"True to his name, 3 year old  Buddy is the perfect companion cat. While you're at work, he'll spend his leisure time bird watching on the windowsill or sleeping in his favorite bed. When you come home he'll be the first to greet you, with a meow and some head butts. During dinner Buddy will respect your spaceâ¦ as long as he gets a taste when you're having his favorite: refried beans! He loves chasing toy mice and batting around stuffed fish to let off some steam before settling down for some cheek scratches and belly rubs during TV time.  

Besides his charming personality and silky soft coat, Buddy stands out for his gentle nature. It's hard to put into words, but he has an ease about him that every veterinarian, rescuer and foster has made note of. As you get to know him, you too will grow to understand what a special cat Buddy is.

- 3 years old, neutered male cat

As you can see in the photos, he has fared quite well in boarding--the last shot, sitting up, shows how thin he was upon rescue, and the other two, well--he's just right!

Our San Juan came in to Manhattan's city shelter as a stray. His tail wasn't working--it was just there, injured, having suffered nerve damage. The tail was amputated, but the nerve damage was a little more far reaching: San Juan wasn't able to urinate on his own, and the urine had to be expressed twice daily so as not to allow toxins to back up as well as for comfort.   HOWEVER...he has healed, and this issue is gone.  One in a while, he poops outside of the box, but we think this may be because of his multi-cat environment.  

His behavior is ""beginner""--which means he's easy to handle, affectionate and friendly.  He is really a lovely boy.

San Juan is vaccinated and felv/fiv negative. He will be neutered shortly.

No additional info,Adult,Cat,Tiger,"COURTESY POST:
These two lovable house cats have been recently abandoned and are living on the street. They need a good foster home or an adoption, and this neighbor is willing to help pay the bills.
The two, recently abandoned house cats are clearly related, but thereâs also a third young grey one that is more shy and might be feral. The rescuer spoke to someone on the block who said that the owner of the two house cats had recently moved.

The cats are now living outside and people in the neighborhood have put food out for them but it is very close to the streets. The rescuer has too many rescued animals to foster them, but they need a temporary (or permanent) home while we can go through the right process to get them adopted.

He had a urinary tract blockage and one of our generous vets kept him till he was sure that it was resolved.  Archie MUST remain on his special diet, which is a crystal-deterrent. If the crystals recur, they may require surgery. Archie is really worth it.
	Archie was worth waiting for.  Sweet, cooperative, friendly, and full of love and affection. However, that is primarily for people. He really wants to be an only pet. He may do best with older children, not young ones.
	Archie is neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative. He is about 2 years old.

When evaluated, he was found to be soliciting attention, head-butting for more petting, and particularly liked to be petted on the head and body.  Saturday will allow you to pick him up, but will not stay in your arms long, jumping down when he is ready.  He is described to be mellow, shy, sweet and curious.  In fact, the assessor gave him the best rating: Beginner, meaning that even a first time cat owner would be fine with him.

We think he has been with us too long, and don't think that he should be with small children, as he shuts down and will not respond well to poking and the like.  However, he remains a sweet cat and once in a home and not a cage, will blossom. (He loves being out of his cage at his boarding facility.).

This bonded pair are sweet mature cats who need a home with lots of love.  Neb (the older one, black)is outgoing and a real lap cat.  He loves belly rubs and loves to sleep on top of you.  Brooklyn (tortie) is more skeptical, but also demands attention when Neb isn't hogging it all.  They have lived with another cat, would be great with children but dogs are an unknown:  Neb would probably do fine, Brooklyn might not.  Brooklyn and Neb are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, felv/fiv negative, and microchipped.  Neb needs a special diet.  Several years ago he had an issue with FLUTD, but has been asymptomatic since being on a urinary diet (Hill's C/D).

Sylvester is very sweet once he gets to know you. He loves to be petted, and is all over his foster mom.  .

Marce, too, is  sweet, but she needs an experienced owner, who will understand that coming over to play or cuddle must be HER decision, not the owner's. Petting, too, is much appreciated--but at Marce's request.

Neither of them enjoys being picked up, so it's best to leave that for when it's really necessary, like annual vet visits. (On the other hand, you can see in their photos that they were not squirmy, angry or uncomfortable.)

Marce and Sylvester should be the only two pets in the house.

Marce is spayed, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.
Sylvester is neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

She is not aggressive, and has lived with cats in boarding.

The boys have a condition acquired in utero called ""cerebella hypoplasia,"" or ""CH."" It is not life-threatening, contagious, or harmful in any way, except it affects their motor skills. Take a look at the 2nd picture of Benny and see his wide stance with his back legs.  That is for balance, and these cats (all with CH) tend to cope beautifully.

These boys are loving and friendly. We don't have information about them with children and other pets, but most CH cats are just fine with all the above.

They are neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Corgi,"Armstrong is a sweet and affectionate pup who would love nothing more than to play and snuggle all day! He has displayed guarding challenges and takes time to warm up to new people, so he would be suited for an experienced adult-only home outside of the city. With a confident leader, he feels more safe and secure and melts into a fluffy goofball. He loves going on long structured walks, running around with his foster siblings, and chasing toys. He may have short legs, but Armstrong is super athletic and loves to show off his agility by running around a big yard and jumping over obstacles. When he's all tuckered out, he'll curl up in his crate and relax. This smartypants has already mastered sit, down, paw, roll over, the ""place command, and how to be well-behaved inside in his foster home and is learning more everyday. Armstrong would thrive with a family that will give him exercise, be diligent with professional training and boundaries, and of course show him lots of love. Armstrong requires a foster-to-adopt home and professional training sessions as determined by Muddy Paws Rescue. He would be best suited for an experienced adult-only home outside of NYC and would benefit from structured training post adoption. Armstrong is 3 years old, up to date on all age appropriate medical care, microchipped, and is fully grown at 30 pounds. This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Husky,"Foster Update: Gunner is a beautiful blonde with white coat and stunning ice blue eyes. He absolutely loves his den-like crate and will go inside without complaint when instructed. He is also housetrained. Outside, he has great stamina and enjoys walks with his human. He is making great progress at keeping it cool when he sees other dogs and horses. He is friendly and loving towards humans, including new adults and kids who want to pet him on the street. Due to his size and strength, he would do best living with a human who can confidently walk a big dog. Inside, our good boy is mellow. Previously, he has had a positive experience living with another dog. At home, he enjoys receiving belly rubs and neck scratches, napping in front of the AC, and playing with toys. Gunner is our first foster who knows how to properly play fetch, dropping the item when instructed! He also knows how to sit. He is an intelligent dog and we are confident that he will be able to learn many more tricks. Overall, he is a loving dog who just wants to be around people! We are excited to find his forever home.

This gorgeous 1-year-old fluffy tuxedo is a very sweet girl but super shy and needs a low key home with someone who ideally has other pets and shy cat experience or is okay with having a cat that prefers to be with other cats than to be with humans. Shes an angel, very gentle, but fearful and seems to thrive around other cats and dogs, and her first foster family says she was more comfortable with children than adults in general, so she would be fine in a home with respectful children. Waddles is a wonderful girl that needs the right home and a chance to find herself.

She is starting to grow into her name with a little help from an extra special foster family! This hound mix is about 7 months old, shy but very loving, great with other pups, fast-learning, and would thrive in an outdoorsy home ideally in the âburbs or country because sheâs pretty jumpy around city noises and buzz. Sheâs about 30 lbs and is still finding her confidence but thrives with the right guidance and environment. Her foster mom says: âTriumph is such a friendly dog! She is great with my husband and follows him around everywhere. She is very smart and is learning âsit.â She is very treat and toy motivated and is not possessive of her food or any items. She loves blankets and anything soft! She will go on her back and do the cutest wiggle when shes laying on the couch. Triumph is THE best snuggler. She curls herself up in a little ball and lets you hold her until you fall asleep. She's a bit skittish outside with loud noises but we have been practicing walking outside and using positive reinforcement on our walks. She has improved even though it as only been a few days. She is not a noisy dog and can be pretty chill even though shes always down to play!â

Triumph would do best in an active household, where she can grow up to be the best hound for your family EVER... if Triumph sounds like the hound pup for you -- APPLY NOW

We suspect Vlad (who now answers to John) is a fairytale creature. He's too majestic and amazing to be a regular old dog (not that there's anything wrong with that). This shepherd mix is about 5 to 6 years old and 85 lbs. He is housebroken, walks well on a leash, and is super friendly with everyone and good with gentle kids! He's good with cats and small dogs, and he's a little picky with big dogs he meets but is fine with them when introduced properly -- he's just not a fan of dogs that get all up in his face. Vlad aka John is a great companion for walks and has good energy but is super melllow at home and mostly sleeps the day away. He has an adorable habit of nuzzling you with his snout when he wants affection, he hasn't experienced any separation anxiety or destructiveness in his foster home, and he is a great sleeper through the night. Vlad has an old injury in one of his hips that sometimes seems to bother him, but our vet said according to x-rays he just needs to take it easy on the exercise, and glucosamine might help. In general, he gets around fine though. He must be in a home out of the city because he is significantly more stresed in urban environemnts, and he loves long walks in nature. He also seems to really enjoy being with small dogs so maybe a small dog companion so he has his own pack.

altered,Adult,Dog,Tibetan Terrier,"Black Jack is a very sweet companion who is always looking for some belly rubs and attention. He is 35 lbs, which is about double what he should be, but he is on a diet and improving every day! Black Jack is a 5-year-old Tibetan spaniel.

His foster mom says ""Of the four fosters Iâve had in my care, Black Jack is the *sweetest*. He just wants loveâ¦ and human food which he cannot have because he has some weight to lose. He is super chill, mainly lounges, but is totally down for a walk whenever. When you sit on the floor, he will run to you and sit in front of you and patiently wait for a belly rub. He likes to tell us when someone is at the door, but besides that, heâs very quiet.

Tyree is a 5 month old hound pup. He is about 21lbs, funny, goofy and a real pup. Tyree is friendly, great with dogs and very nosy ;-) duh obviously this hound nose is divine and picks up on everything. He will likely grow to be about 45-50lbs fully grown and would do best outside in the city, in a suitable home that can give him the exercise he needs and let him explore the outdoors, because Tyree LOVES IT. If you think you need to get your hands on this baby boy with velvet ears...APPLY NOW!

Wilflower is a uniquely gorgeous girl. This 4-year-old tabby is about 13 lbs, and she was born with one cutely crinkled ear. She is shy at first, and it takes her a minute to warm up to a new place, but once she does she is super sweet and easy going, and she's good with other animals but also does fine as the only pet in the home as long as she's getting enough loving from her humans. Her foster mom says: ""She's the sweetest cat ever. (: It took a while for her to get used to the apartment, but once she feels comfortable, she has become the sweetest and best behaved cat. She loves playing with her toys or anything she finds. She loves cuddles, she even comes over when she is called. She is very talkative as well. She gets up with us every morning, walk with us around the apartment with the sweetest meows. She will make the best pet once she is adopted!""

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Young,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Border Collie']","Basil is a super sweet lab mix, but kind of a scaredy cat. She's a year old, about 50 lbs, and came from a home where she was barely socialized -- she's jumpy around outdoor noises and can be shy in new situations, but she's super smart, very eager to trust, learns fast, and settles in well once she's had a day or two to chill out. She's great with small dogs on the calmer side but seems to be afraid of bigger dogs and pups that come at her with too much playful energy. She walks okay on a leash but could use some more time outside getting used to the sights and sounds. She's very playful, an awesome jogging partner, and a great cuddle companion indoors. Basil would do best in an active home ideally out of the city or in a quiet neighborhood where she can get a slower introduction to the wide world around her. She would get along great with another chill smaller dog for a buddy who can guide the way. Her foster dad says: ""This is our 6th time fostering. Basil was kind of a mess when I first picked her up, but she is a really quick leaner. She went from peeing the in house to only peeing outside in 2 days. She can be shy in public and startles easily, but definitely very curious and I see her warming up to other dogs, other people and the outside world pretty fast. I keep her away from dogs that are larger than her to help her confidence. She seems to be afraid of the crate as well, but we're working on that too. At home she is very playful and loving -- definitely a snuggler! She has a lot of energy which I think is normal for labs especially a 1 year old. I run with her a couple miles every day. She's a great running buddy! Doesn't pull that much. I see her as a diamond in the ruff right now. With a little TLC and training she will be a great dog."" Interested in adopting?

Tinsley is a tiny sprite of a girl. She's about 2 years old and 6 lbs but should be closer to 7 lbs, she's a little underweight from neglect. Tinsley is your typical Chihuahua -- gets super attached to her people and wants to be in your lap all the time and give you lots and lots of kisses. She's good with most dogs off leash but can get pretty worked up when she sees them on the sidewalk so she's working on her leash skills. She is extremely smart, she gets SUPER excited to see you when you get home and does the most hilarious little shimmy along the floor as she follows your feet, and she is very responsive and eager to please!

What a lady. Pepper is a green eyed seductress with an exotic torbie coat -- flecks of gold catch the sunlight and shine like fish scales when she sits in the rays pouring through the window. Her name doesn't quite fit this mysterious, hypnotizing animal. She should be an Anastasia or a Vanessa or a Sapphire. Pepper is about 10 years old, 12 lbs, and she's very friendly, social, and eager to receive cheek scratches. She's easy going and seems good with other animals so far, though she's pretty new to us so we are stil learning. She has a tipped ear, which indicates that she was found stray, spayed, and returned to the streets where she was found by some animal loving TNR group at some point in her past. Hard to imagine such a regal, affectionate kitty on the streets -- we're so glad she made her way to us.

Misha is an epic sweetheart. This girl is 7 years old, 9 lbs, and hasn't been loved probably at all in her life but is very eager to have affection. She's great with other dogs (but a little feisty when on the leash), highly intelligent, and would do best in a medium active to active home. She's a mega snuggler and loves to go for adventures!

I rescued her 11 years ago, and she has been a very beloved pet and family member. She is an older cat and will need extra loving tenderness and patience, but she is in stable health. And is very snuggly!
>> Temperament:
>> She's very sweet, gentle, calm, and loves to cuddle. she is very sweet to my German Shepard mix dog.
>> Kib has a few health issues that will need to be considered:
>> - She has been FIV positive since I adopted her 11 years ago, but she does not seem to have any significant symptoms of a compromised immune system at this point. I suspect some gum/teeth issues are related to this (she has most of her teeth missing).
>> - In the past few years, she was diagnosed with diabetes. She went into remission, but just this weekend got test results saying that she has it again. She would need to be given insulin daily.
>> - She has a heart condition that causes her to occasionally stumble and fall when she's very stressed out. This is rare.
0Her doctors do not seem to think she is anywhere near needing to be put down, but she needs a comfortable, stable, and supportive home to live out the rest of her life comfortably with an owner who will have the time and dedication to care for her as she continues to age. Despite her health challenges, on a day-to-day basis she seems quite happy and health.y

Bentley is very active and strong, and just wants to play all day.  He needs a lot of training and someone who has dog experience.  He loves other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog (or multiple dogs). 

Due to his strength and lack of training, only someone who is either strong enough to handle him should adopt him, or someone who has help in handling him.  His ideal situation would be in a home with more than one person and another dog, and a yard.  We have sent Bentley to training school in May 2018, and he has made a lot of progress, but it's important that whoever adopts him continues with that training and leads with a firm, yet humane, hand.  Bentley thrives in the presence of other dogs and is always submissive to them, so we can't reiterate enough that he really would do best in a home with another dog.

hasShots,Baby,Dog,Mixed Breed,"Larry arrived in NYC from Thailand at the beginning of April 2018.  He is around 10 months old as of July 2018.  While he was very active and friendly in Thailand and at his first foster home in NYC, he has become very shy at his second foster home, and he will need some work with coming out of his shell.  He also needs some serious leash training, as he has not been walked on a leash at all.  He loves other dogs, but the first meeting with new dogs can be very rough, as he gets very defensive.  He loosens up afterward, and then looks for the dog he met after he left (as though he regrets growling and being defensive). 

Larry was tied up in a garbage bag with his siblings as a little baby and had his paws tied together and was dumped near a shelter in South Thailand.  Thankfully, he was saved just in time, and all of his siblings came to NYC in late January and all got adopted.  Larry came a couple of months after they did, and now it's Larry's turn to find a forever home. 

Here are some video just after he arrived in NYC.  He is still acting kind of coy and shy, but he is coming out of his shell more and more everyday,  https://www.amazon.com/photos/share/fgfOY7SZ4prRtoUu5AsCMR2dagKGMVZT0iymJkdRRln

altered,Young,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"Rescued from the train tracks at the 103rd Street Station in Harlem on the 6 line, Choo Choo (also known as Bob Tail) had a badly infected piece of a tail that had to be amputated.  Through it all, he purred, nuzzled, head-butted, and showed love to every human and animal he has encountered. 

His tail surgery went well, and he is healed and ready to get out of a cage at the vet's office and into someone's home.  We are desperately seeking, at the very least, a foster home, so that this boy can walk freely and sit on a windowsill and enjoy his life after everything he has been through.  He is getting restless in the cage at the vet's office, and just wants a home!

housetrained,Young,Cat,Tabby,"Rocky has been stuck at a cage at our vet's office for months...he was rescued by a very nice man who had nowhere to put him, so he has boarded him at the vet.  We noticed him there every time we would visit, and when we started to talk to him and pet him, we saw just how sweet he was.  

The reason why no one wants Rocky is that he has FIV, but as cat rescuers, we know that this is not contagious!  We have had FIV cats in our homes with our other cats for many years, and it does not spread in the traditional ways that diseases spread.  Rocky does not deserve a life of depression in a cage because of something that is not even contagious!

Please find it in your heart to foster Rocky until he can get a home.  He is gentle, handsome, and very grateful for every hello and scratch on the chin he can get.  Here are some videos we shot of him last night (6/1/2018):  https://www.amazon.com/photos/share/1rJOm9EcmPulwcVjaUir9W0Fnl9yhjWLAVpNQPsrvbS

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,"['Terrier', 'Wirehaired Terrier']","Momma is a 2-3 year old street dog from the North of Thailand who suffered immensely out on the streets as her babies were born into suffering, and all of them would die with each time that she would give birth.  An ex-pat rescuer stepped in and got her last litter of puppies and saved all 11 of them earlier this year.  Her daughter, Girl (shown in the fourth with her), from a litter she had over a year ago, was the only other survivor out of all of her babies born prior to this year.  She is very close with Girl and it is our hope that someone can at least foster them together for a few weeks while we search for a forever home for both of them, whether they are adopted together or separately.  

She is kind of scruffy looking and her fur is kind of wiry, and we know she's a hard sell, but if we didn't take this lady in, no one else would have ever helped her.  We believe in her and know that someone special is out there to give her the life she deserves, who will be patient with her and understand that the trauma she went through on the streets makes her shy until she gets to know someone.  Once she trusts someone, she is warm and affectionate.  If her daughter is near her, she will enact out affection on her to let you know she is starting to trust you.  For example, when she sees you, if she wants to jump up and hug you and lick you, she will instead do it to her daughter, to show you that she is happy to see you.  She just needs time and patience to win over her heart. She is not aggressive at all.

She is very friendly, and is a source of support for her mother, who is more guarded after all of the trauma that she endured on the street, watching her babies get run over and poisoned for years.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,Australian Shepherd,"SCOUT used to live in a home with his devoted human and two siblings, Trix and Sasha. But Scout's whole world recently turned upside down when his person passed away very suddenly. The three dogs were in one crate on their way to the city shelter when we made a last minute, split-second decision to take them into our rescue. 

The three dogs were checked out by our vet then went off to two different foster homes. Scout and Trix went to one and their big sister Sasha went off to another.

Knowing what a tall order it is to adopt out three dogs together let alone even two, we made the gut-wrenching decision to only adopt out Scout and Trix together, and Sasha, alone. *Sasha has since been placed in a wonderful home with another dog!

Scout is an 18 pound, 2 year old Papillion mix. He is housebroken, good with other dogs and walks great on the leash. He looks out for his sister Trix who despite being much older, loves to play with her brother.

No additional info,Senior,Dog,Chihuahua,"TRIX used to live in a home with her devoted human and two siblings, Scout and Sasha. But Trix's whole world recently turned upside down when her person passed away very suddenly. The three dogs were in one crate on their way to the city shelter when we made a last minute, split-second decision to take them into our rescue. 

The three dogs were checked out by our vet then went off to two different foster homes. Trix and Scout went to one and their big sister Sasha went off to another.

Knowing what a tall order it is to adopt out three dogs together let alone even two, we made the gut-wrenching decision to only adopt out Trix and Scout together, and Sasha, alone. *Sasha has since been placed in a wonderful home with another dog!

Trix is an 8 pound, 10 year old Chihuahua mix. She is housebroken, good with other dogs and walks great on the leash. She looks to her younger brother Scout for support and confidence. And despite being much older, she loves to play with her brother. Considering all that they have been through, this bonded pair is certainly well-adjusted and looking forward to all the newness that comes with Spring, including, hopefully, a new family.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'noKids']",Young,Dog,Norwich Terrier,"MAXIMUS is a mixed breed Norwich Terrier. He's estimated by our vet to be about 3 years old and weighs 16 pounds.

Max came into our care after we heard that someone dumped him at a vet's office in Brooklyn where he was living in a cage for almost a year. Sure he was walked here and there but he was never properly socialized or put on a housebreaking schedule.

But that hasn't set him back any! Max is doing great with all the dogs in his foster home, both big and small. And he's getting the lay of the land when it comes to using the bathroom outside. Max does guard his dog bed and food bowl so we will not be able to place Max in a home with children under the age of 12.

Like any dog, Max will need some time to adjust to his new home and when he does you will have the very best friend you could have dreamed of. A loyal, sweet and fun-loving small dog. Perfect for an apartment or a house!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"HAPPY got his name because when we rescued him from the shelter he was nothing but smiles. 

At just 1-2 years old, Happy is a gorgeous 57 pounds with the most stunning green eyes. Happy shares his current foster home with another bully breed who is much bigger than he and the two get along famously. 

Even though he is a happy boy, Happy is scared of new things and will cower if you raise your hand too quickly. Happy is the poster-child for pit bull myths as this boy is nothing but gentle and sweet. If anything he's the one who's reluctant to trust us. Slow and steady wins the race with Happy.

Happy is housebroken, loves car rides and walks well on the leash, only pulling when he is real interested in something.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Dachshund,"RONDA is an 8 year old sweet, purebred Doxie who's former family completely gave up on her. Not only did they never get her the vet care she needed, but they then decided they were through with her and tied her up to a lamp post until she was rescued by the police.

The police brought Ronda to the shelter and we rescued her from there -- eager to rewrite her story and give her the happiest ending ever. Ronda has likely never had a dental cleaning in her life. We are taking care of that at our vet prior to adoption but we are looking for folks who won't shy away from such care in the future. We are also looking for a home in which has very few stairs or an elevator. You know, cause Doxie. 

Ronda loves to go for walks, and is starting to engage the other dogs in her foster home. Ronda is the perfect little apartment dog cause she rarely ever barks! She doesn't mind being bathed and gets real excited during meal time. Another perk about Ronda is she has no problems with you touching her food bowl or taking something out of her mouth. She's too cute for words and communicates with her fosters in an almost human-like way.

Ronda came to us only willing to use a pee pad but she has since gotten on a schedule and now does her business outside.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,"['Rottweiler', 'Pit Bull Terrier']","MATT is a one year old 33 pound Rottie mixed with Pit. He is extremely loving and loves to be near his foster mom. He is a young boy who has heaps of energy but once he gets rid of it through normal doggy running and play, he's happy to just chill and cuddle. He transforms into the perfect lapdog!

Matt shares his foster home with other dogs and is being trained to sleep in the crate at night. He recognizes his crate as a safe and happy place and never puts up a stink when it's time to go in there. While we have no problem with crate training, our goal for Matt is to one day be integrated into his forever home more completely. Either in the bed with his humans or in a dog bed close to his humans.

In the morning Matt is used to going right outside as he is still learning the ropes to housebreaking. He then gets his breakfast and does the cutest little twirly dance because he's beyond excited to get his food. 

Matt walks very well on the leash and doesnât pull. He tries to chase squirrels here and there but can be very easily redirected. It seems like pure fun and NOT prey drive. He pulls slightly towards other dogs he sees on the way, but again, he can be very easily redirected. 

Matt is also crated when his foster mom leaves the home as she has other dogs who have free roam. While he's not a big fan of her leaving the barking is minimal and dissipates soon after she is gone. This level of separation anxiety is minor and will disappear completely when he is in a stable, loving forever home. In general, Matt is not a big barker. He doesn't bark when the doorbell rings nor does he charge the door. 

Matt is super smart and eager to please. Heâs beginning to master the sit command like a champ. He's also very treat-motivated and takes them from your hands gently. He isnât a mouthy dog and would probably love a home with children who won't ride him, or pull his tail. In other words, kids must be over the age of 7 please!

Dylan is also super smart and inquisitive. So much so that he utilizes the furniture in his foster home to get him to where all the dog food is. No dog before him in his foster home (and there has been many!) has ever done that.

Dylan loves children and also loves other dogs. We'd be happy to place him and LD in a home with either just as long as the child is over the age of 5.

In his foster home Dylan loves to sleep next to his foster mom at night. He likes to burrow under the blankets and settles up close for the night. We are looking for a home for Dylan in which he will be allowed to sleep wherever he is comfortable, which will most likely be your bed!

Dylan is great on the leash and really enjoys going for long walks. He also loves car rides.

LD likes children and also loves other dogs. We'd be happy to place her and Dylan in a home with either just as long as the child is over the age of 5.

You can teach LD to do pretty much anything with a little treat. She is so food motivated but at the same time has no issues when it comes to food. You can touch her food bowl when she is eating and she takes treats from your hands ever so gently. 

LD loves to go for walks and enjoys sitting on her human while they watch TV. She's a total lap dog and also enjoys being held. She's an ideal apartment dog thanks to her size and the fact that she barely makes a peep!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Border Collie']","Our magnificent Hero needs a hero of his own. This beautiful, robust boy is a victim of circumstances. His doting owner lost her home, and desperately tried to find housing to accommodate her beloved companion, whom she had raised from a pup. Hero's Mom took up temporary residence in a local motel, until she could get her bearings, but Hero was booted out by the motel manager. After a tearful goodbye, sad Hero was left in the care of a well-respected town shelter, who pled his case to us.

Hero appears to be a handsome mix of black Labrador Retriever and Border Collie. He has the physique and color of a black Lab, and the white tuxedo markings and black speckled white socks that suggest Border Collie. At 50 pounds, Hero has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Hero loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Hero sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the structure that he needs to to thrive. Hero gives the impression of caution at first, as he sizes up strangers, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. Adopters will need to be comfortable putting boundaries between Hero and strangers: he can become overzealous in guarding his person. He would be the ideal watchdog.

Hero seems subdued and intimidated at times, in the midst of our busy foster home, and we sense that a quiet, adult home would suit him best. He is not a big fan of change, and a steady, quiet routine will serve him beautifully.  Hero would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, can keep a brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Hero could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Hero has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. The obedience work serves him as a job he can take pride in, and he performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Hero has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Hero's transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DA2PP (distemper, adrenovirus, parvo and parainfluenza), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Border Collie']","Our stunning Wednesday enters the room like an arctic blast of cold on a hot summer night and grabs your attention! This magnificent one and a half year old, black Labrador Retriever mix came to us from a big city Animal Control facility, where she spent some time after a lackluster owners abandoned her. She was rail thin and gaunt when she entered the city shelter system, and took some time to adjust to her harsh surroundings. 

When Wednesday came to our Rescue, she was a wild child, a Black Beauty in need of some firm, loving leadership. It was painfully obvious that her owners had missed all of her social development cues, and woefully neglected her manners and leadership training. Wednesday was as precocious as her Addams Family namesake, and seemed to feel that her opinion was warranted on just about every subject.

In no time, Wednesday has developed into a canine thoroughbred, brimming with potential. An energy and personality match is key to Wednesday's happiness. She is a high energy, athletic dog who needs alot of outdoor exercise. She would gleefully keep rigorous pace with an avid runner, hiker or powerwalker, and seems to thrive in the brisk country air. No doubt about it, Wednesday needs an active adopter, but, also one who is extremely proficient in leadership and obedience training. She is not a dog for the casual or inexperienced adopter.

Wednesday largely appears to be Labrador Retriever, but we also suspect some Border Collie in her DNA. She is a lean, tall dog weighing 47 pounds, and is extremely graceful and athletic. She runs with great speed, and could be an agility champion. Wednesday has the energy and intelligence that we see in this high strung Herding breed, as well as the mischievious and impertinent tendency that sometimes occurs when Border Collies are under exercised and bored! 

As a double dose of working dog, Wednesday definitely needs a job, and she is a natural at obedience work. She knows all her basic commands, and has passed many of the Canine Good Citizenship tests. She handles beautifully on lead, and heels nicely. Wednesday still needs some polish on her stranger manners, since she may, on occasion, greet someone rudely, but motivated adopters should be able to work her through any issues by employing her well honed commands. In the right hands, Wednesday will become a fantastic, well behaved companion.

Wednesday would fare best in an adult home, with adopters experienced in handling large, active breeds. She would overwhelm toddlers and seniors. She could easily join a multi-dog home, with another active, well trained dog, but sometimes, unruly and ill mannered dogs press her buttons. We have not had her around cats, but she would most likely chase them beyond their tolerance level.

Wednesday has respectable house manners and is mostly housetrained. She will need some finetuning on her potty routine as she transitions to a new environment. Wednesday is in good health, and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for rabies, bordatella, and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been microchipped and dewormed, and is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm treatment.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,"['Rottweiler', 'Hound']","Our Cupid is a sage soul, who found himself homeless, along with his housemate Eskie, Precious, after his family lost their residence. He entered the confines of NYC ACC, and did not fare well during the rescue process. He became shy, shut down, and suspicious of human touch, so Shelter workers directed him to us, so that we could evaluate him in a more hospitable environment.

We were happy to invite this sad soul to join us, and he has really come out of his shell in foster care. At first meeting, Cupid seems shy and reticent, but he warms quickly once he reconnects to a loving human vibe. He has adjusted beautifully to foster care, has been a joy to handle. Cupid loves people, and is generally friendly to strangers, once he warms up, but would be happiest in a quiet adult home, where he can chill out. 

Cupid would be the ideal companion to an active single, or couple, who have large dog, or Rottie experience. Powerful breeds like Rottweillers and Hounds that have a work ethic bred into their DNA, require purposeful lifestyles that challenge their mental and physical faculties. They also need a strong pack leader to teach them Canine Good Citizenship.

Cupid has excelled in his obedience work, and this is a great way for an adopter to bond with him, and continue to assume a positive leadership role. Cupid has mastered all of his basic obedience commands, and adopters will be able to get him up to speed and into their lifestyle quickly. Cupid has a moderate energy level and does not require an untoward amount of exercise. A couple of brisk leash walks each day should do the trick and keep him happy and balanced.

As an adult dog, Cupid is calm and well behaved in the house. He could easily live in an apartment or home environment, and he would be fine during an 8-hour work day. He would also be happy as the companion to an active retiree with lots of time to spend with him. We think that Cupid may be too sensitive to tolerate young children, and we have not had him around cats. He could easily join a multi-dog home, as he seems to enjoy companionship with his own kind, and has become one of the superstars in our large dog play group.

Cupid has good house manners, and is house trained, to the best of our observation, although adopters need to have realistic expectations of Rescue dogs, who may lose some of their potty Mojo and they as they go from place to place during this unwieldy process. We expect adopters to troubleshoot any housetraining issues after the fact.

Cupid is in excellent health, and has been neutered. He is vaccinated for Rabies, Parvo, adrenovirus, distemper, coronavirus, leptopirosis, canine influenza, and bordatella. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Young,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Our Epi has as grand of soul as we have ever encountered. This big, bombastic beauty is a natural born cuddler who longs to become someone's Number One. She came to us recently from NYC ACC, where overbred Bully breeds are euthanized by the hundreds before they can get an even break in life.

Epi was found as a city stray, and was taken to the Brooklyn Care Center. Despite frantic shelter life, Epi has made a remarkable impression on everyone she met. Shelter staff and volunteers agreed that Epi is spectacular, and she received the best behavior evaluations. At first it seemed likely that Epi would be reunited with her owner, but sadly no one came forward to claim her. 

We were made aware of Epi's plight and were asked to step up for her. We are so glad we did. This dog is destined to be the light of someone's life. She is an older puppy at just one year old, who's never had the benefit of any training or leadership. Her temperament is pure gold. She loves everyone, and is so full of joy, that she lights up a room when she enters.

In a culture that vilifies the Bully Breeds, Epi stands out as an ideal dog for an active family with older, teenaged kids. She is a tri-color American Staffordshire Terrier, and is a high energy dog, muscular and strong at 60 pounds. While she loves to play with kids, she will overwhelm young children. She would do best in an active home, in which she can play a prominant role, with folks who understand the ongoing importance of exercise and leadership. If Epi is neglected to the point of boredom and frustration, she will likely make mayhem.

Epi enjoys the companionship of other dogs, but is prone to rough-house play. She can easily join a multi-dog home, but energy levels must be matched and some attempt must be made to maintain calm, because rough play can bubble over into canine disagreements. We have not had her around cats, but she would definitely chase them in play beyond their tolerance.

Epi is responding beautifully to her leash training, and has calmed down quite a bit since we have established a regular routine with her. However, some physical strength is necessary to handle her on lead, and she requires a good amount of exercise to keep her calm and focused.

Epi has good house manners and loves her crate. She will benefit from ongoing obedience work, but is full of potential for the right bully breed lover. Epi has such a phenomenal temperament that she could easily coast all the way to Canine Good Citizenship Certification in the hands of motivated adopters.

Epi has decent housemanners for an older puppy, and is housetrained and crate trained. Adopters are expected to forgive a few accidents during the course of her transition to a new routine, and fine-tune the potty schedule as appropriate. Epi is in excellent health, and is recently spayed. She is up to date on routine shots, and is dewormed and microchipped. Epi has tested negative for Heartworm, Lyme, Earlichia and Anaplasmosis.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,"['Pit Bull Terrier', 'Labrador Retriever']","Our magnificent Panda an elegant quality that folks don't expect in their Bully Breeds. This pretty boy has the bouyant good nature that attracts Bully breed folks to these lovable high energy scamps. No other dog group has been so overbred, mishandled and maligned as the Bullies, and we are thrilled to have Panda with us, at this young stage of his life, so that we can find his forever home.

Three years old, Panda started off his rescue journey as a statistic: just one more homeless stray roaming the mean city streets. He was picked up and brought to NYC ACC. He hasc traversed the rescue process with ease, and has displayed great confidence and panache as he has interacted with everyone along the way. His behavior evaluations were exemplary, and he was used as a ""Social Greeter"" dog within the shelter's behavioral Network, to help dogs feel at ease in the process.

Despite good behavior evaluations, Panda was passed over for adoption in favor of the numerous puppies available. He was designated for the euthanasia list, but shelter workers managed to secure him a last minute foster home spot in their Network, and he was sitting pretty for a few months. Unfortunately he was attacked by another dog on the street, and was returned to the shelter with some minor wounds to treat. 

Shelter staff sent Panda to us, so that we could continue his foster care and find his forever home. He joined us a few months ago, along with Celia, another large bully, and they quickly became great friends. Panda appears to be a mix of American Pit Bull Terrier and black Labrador Retriever suggested by his graceful stance and height. He is a large strong dog at 60 pounds, with a lean, muscular physique, and floppy Lab ears. He has a broad skull that suggest some Bully DNA, but his muzzle narrows into a triangular Lab shape. He has a wide swath of white, sweeping down his chest that gives him a regal tuxedo look. Panda truly represents the best of beauty and temperament in both breeds. He has charmed everyone he has met, in the face of trying circumstances.

Panda would be a fantastic choice for a Lab or Bully breed lover, who is willing to continue his exercise and obedience regimen. Panda is high energy, and needs adequate exercise. He loves to be on the go: the more action, the better. A bored, frustrated Bully will make mischief, to be sure, but in the hands of dedicated breed enthusiasts, who rejoice in their high energy companions, Bullies are Man's devoted BFFs.

Panda is an ideal choice for an active single or couple. He is friendly, and good with most strangers, but he would likely overpower young toddlers. We haven't had him around cats, but he likes most other well mannered dogs. He loves to play with other dogs matched to him for size and energy level, and would be a great companion to another well-trained dog.

Panda has excelled at his obedience training and is extremely food motivated. He responds well to positive reinforcement training, and has learned all of his commands, so that adopters will be able to get up to speed with him quickly. He has great house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters will need to forgive the occasional accident that might occur as Panda transitions to a new potty routine, in a new home. 

Panda has been thoroughly vetted. Like many bully breeds, his sensitive skin will benefit from a grain free diet rich in quality protein and Omega fats. He has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo and parainfluenza, coronavirus), and has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats']",Young,Dog,"['Pit Bull Terrier', 'Whippet']","Our winsome Juicy loves to mug for the camera with a ""Sad Sack"" expression but then amps up the puppy play vibe in real-time! This lanky girl came to us from New York Animal Care and Control, where she found herself, after a brief run as a city stray. Juicy was on a stray hold, while shelter workers frantically tried to reach her owner, but sadly no one could be found. At that point she had caught the typical shelter virus, and was quickly relegated to the euthanasia list.

Juicy is a comical girl and has a string bean physique that makes us think of Popeye's Olive Oil. We are convinced that she has some sighthound DNA! At first glance, Juicy appears to be an American Pitbull Terrier, but she's very tall and weighs only 35 lb. Juicy has a dramatic color pattern of black and white patches, strategically placed over eyes to give her the look of double ""shiners"". Like many Bullies, Juicy has sensitive skin, and does best on a grain-free diet high in Omega fats.

Juicy would make a great companion to an active single or couple who love to walk, hike or run. She is a natural athlete, and loves to spend time outdoors. Two years old, Juicy is well past the puppy destructive stage, but still has vibrant puppyish energy. She is extremely smart and has responded well to her obedience work. She has the potential to be a Canine Good Citizen.

Juicy is a friendly girl, who likes everyone, and has not shown any ""stranger danger."" She would be fine with older kids, but toddlers might overstimulate her. She could join a multi-dog home, and is generally good with most polite and well trained dogs. Juicy does not care for ill-mannered dogs, who do not respect her boundaries. She will readily rebuke a dog who gets in her face. We think that she might chase cats in play, perhaps beyond their comfort level.

Juicy has decent house manners for a young adult, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect the occasional accident as she transitions to a new home. Juicy is in excellent health, and is spayed. She is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza coronavirus, canine influenza, and bordatella. She has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noDogs', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,"['Miniature Pinscher', 'Dachshund']","Our tiny Oscar came to us last year as an emergency case from NYC ACC. This tiny 10 pound Miniature Pinscher-Dachshund mix had been hit by a car and was incapacitated by the side of the road when good samaritans brought him to the shelter for medical care.

It's amazing that Oscar survived his injuries, which were extensive. He had a fractured lower jaw that left his muzzle swollen and painful. Also, he sustained a fractured hip, which would require surgery in the near future, once his considerable soft tissue injuries and swelling subsided.

After several months of TLC, surgery, and medical care, Oscar is 100 percent, and ready for his new home. And yet, the trauma of such an injury leaves some wounds on the spirit. Oscar needs a patient adopter, with some rescue chops, willing to troubleshoot unpredictable behavior with some strangers, and some initial handling issues, due to random aches and pains caused by his injuries. Oscar has shown us that he can bond like glue to his loving handlers, and accept gentle touch, but there will be some likely ups and downs in the first couple of weeks as he adjusts to new people.

Oscar is a gentle, shy boy, who needs patience to allow him time to warm up and bond. He will thrive in the quiet home of a laid back single or couple, and perhaps another good natured dog, or friendly cat, to help him adjust. He's not a good candidate for hectic family life, and he will surely be spooked by the overzealous affections of toddlers.

Oscar is a medium energy dog, and needs a couple of leisurely walks each day, with an assertive handler, who has earned his trust. He is an energetic little Scamp, who loves to be in the middle of the action. We have begun him on a basic obedience routine, and he seems happy to work for treats and praise. The obedience training process has gone a long way toward building Oscar's confidence. Adopters should continue him on a training regimen to develop his potential. Confident leadership is the key to success with Oscar.

Oscar has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters must have appropriate expectations of a recently neutered dog, and be willing to fine tune potty habits as Oscar adjusts to a new routine.

Just five years old, Oscar is in excellent health, and has bounced back nicely from his injuries. He has been neutered and vaccinated for rabies and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been microchipped and dewormed.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,"['Chihuahua', 'Italian Greyhound']","Our Spice is one adorable pipsqueak, with a BIG personality. He is one of the most jovial canine characters that we've met in sometime. Our collective mind boggles at yet another beautiful, sweet, adult dog adrift on the city streets, who arrived at NYCACC as a beleaguered homeless stray. We feel like Fantasia's Mickey Mouse, as the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" awash in just one more bucket of water.

Spice is a rare soul, who survived the NYCACC brouhaha without completely losing his mind. At first, Spice showed some fearful behavior to shelter staff and volunteers, and finally, we were called in on Spice's behalf, so that he could have space to unwind and decompress before adoption. We are thrilled that Spice is with us, and he has blended beautifully into his new foster home, quickly adapting to house rules.

Spice is a five year old, adult Chihuahua, who looks like he's on stilts! There's no mistaking the Chi Apple head, But the floppy ears and long, long legs, suggest a bit of Italian Greyhound. His personality favors the outspoken and opinionated Chihuahua, rather than the nervous IG. At 9 pounds, he is a tiny boy, with a lean, athletic physique built for the Peewee high jump. He would be a great choice for an experienced Chihuahua lover who relishes the creative, comical hijinks that this whimsical breed is famous for.

Spice would do well in the active home of a single or couple who have the time to focus on his exercise and obedience work. Or, he could join a busy family lifestyle, where he could flounce around as the center of attention. Spice loves human contact, but can become nervous around toddlers. He would enjoy the gentle attention of older kids or teens, and would fit in nicely in a multi-dog home. Spice might be fine around cats, but a cat-dog introduction would be necessary before any decision is made.

Spice has excellent house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to forgive the occasional accident as Spice adapts to his new potty routine. He travels well, and is an ideal car passenger. He is small enough to fit into the airline approved Sherpa bag, and would be a great companion on plane trips.

Spice appears to be well cared for: his skin and coat are soft and lustrous, and his teeth and gums are in good shape for an adult dog. A consistent dental care plan will go a long way to avoid future dental cleanings and extractions. Spice is in excellent health and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and had a negative fecal test.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noDogs', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Our vivacious Freda has the bouyant good nature that attracts American Pit Bull Terrier folks to this lovable breed. No other breed has been so overbred, mishandled and maligned as the APBT, and we are thrilled to have Freda with us, early in her young life, so that we can find her forever home.

Three years old, Freda started off her rescue journey as a statistic: just one more homeless pit roaming the mean city streets. She has traversed the rescue process with ease, and has displayed great confidence and panache as she has interacted with everyone along the way. (Well... except the police officer who brought her to NYCACC. We hear that she was not his biggest fan, especially after he pepper- sprayed her in the eyes). Freda's shelter behavior evaluations were good, and she was adopted through the shelter adoption program to a young couple who learned quickly that Freda was not a good fit for their low key lifestyle.

NYCACC approached us on Freda's behalf, because Staff and Volunteers had fallen in love with this russet beauty, and we invited her to Connecticut. Freda has been handled with great love, and has a friendly, outgoing temperment, although, she is not a fan of rough handling. She would be a fantastic choice for a gentle bully breed lover, who is willing to continue her exercise and obedience regimen. 

Freda is high energy and needs vigorous exercise. She loves to be on the go: the more action, the better. A bored, frustrated Bully will surely make mischief, but in the hands of dedicated breed enthusiasts, who rejoice in their high energy companions, Pitties are Man's devoted BFFs.

Freda is a total stunner. She is a Red Nose, ABPT, and has twinkling greenish-hazel eyes. Her coat is a pretty reddish carmel with white tuxedo markings, and cute white socks. Freda is a strong muscular dog, and she is at an ideal weight of 50 pounds. She is a strong girl, who require some experienced handling on leash walks. Freda knows all of her basic obedience commands and handles well with assertive leadership.

We think that Freda will thrive in the active home of the experienced Bully Breed lovers, who have a basic understanding of dog behavior and obedience techniques. Freda is very responsive to training, and is both treat and praise motivated. We'd like to avoid homes with small children, since Freda is a strong dog, and may overpower toddlers.

Freda would probably do best in an only dog environment, where she can bask in her family's attention. Freda's adapters will be able to walk her easily on lead in a public place or urban environment, but she may not be an appropriate candidate for unstructured play in a public dog park. Freda likes to play rough, and rough-house play among high energy.dogs can often bubble up into a tiff or two! Freda is not a good candidate for a feline home.

Freda has been thoroughly vetted.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,"['Siberian Husky', 'Samoyed']","Our lovely Chanel is a gregarious beauty who loves everyone! She recently joined us from a New Jersey shelter, where she had spent some time after her verklempt Owner dropped her off, amid personal crisis. After charming staff and receiving great behavior evaluations, Chanel was passed over in the shelter adoption program, so she came to us so that we could find her perfect home.

Chanel appears to be a pretty mix of Siberian Husky and Samoyed. She has one brown eye and one blue eye, as a nod to her Husky heritage. Chanel is a stocky, plus sized girl, who rocked the scale at 99 pounds upon arrival. She's at the beginning of her much-needed weight loss journey, and she's already down 11 pounds. At ideal weight, Chanel should be in the 65 to 70 pound range. 

Chanel has the thick double coat that we see in Samoyeds, with a good deal of biscuit coloring. Her mid length, fluffy coat requires regular brushing, but is easy to groom, and Chanel enjoys the grooming process. Chanel seems more like the magnanimous Samoyed in personality: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. And yet, she seems to have a slight sadness about her, and is likely feeling confused and disoriented with the rescue process.

Chanel has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. She certainly is food motivated, and will respond to positive rewards based training as well as leadership work. Chanel would be the ideal family dog. She can be trusted with older kids, and generally does not fear strangers. Chanel is not the type of dog to pick one family member over the other. Rather, she will spread the love evenly and ingratiate herself to everyone.

Chanel is easy to walk on lead and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee. She has a tendency to overeat, so attention must be paid to appropriate portion size and to a moderate exercise regimen so that Chanel can continue her weight loss. She would be the ideal walking or hiking companion, but then she can be counted on to take a long nap afterwards.

Chanel would be a great choice for a moderately active family, single or couple, or a recent retiree. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Chanel seems to get along with other dogs, and she could easily join a multi-dog home, and possibly even a feline home. Chanel is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where the next phase of her life will be spent center stage, rather than considered dosposable.

Chanel has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. At the age of four, Chanel is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and she has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, microchipped and is on preventatives for Heartworm and Flea/Tick.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,"['Foxhound', 'Boxer']","Our lovely Mama suffered a tortuous intake process at NYCACC, after her owner repeatedly berated her in the crowded shelter Lobby. Our shelter contact witnessed the verbal tongue-lashing and watched in horror as Mama cowered, and shook spastically throughout the entire intake. As Mama was led into the back kennel area, we were called and ask to help her.

Mama is one of those dogs who just brightens the room whenever she enters. It's amazing that such a lovely creature could be so callously abandoned at the age of ten. Mama is a grand old gal, who needs a happy retirement home to spend her golden years. She had earned stellar behavior evaluations, and was placed in the Shelter adoption program, only to be passed over because of her age. 

Although Mama was a favorite among shelter staff and volunteers, her adoption options were limited. Seems that everybody wants to experience puppy hell, and too few people appreciate the considerable benefits of having an older dog, who is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She came to our rescue so that we could cast a wide net, and find her just the right Adopter. 

Mama appears to be a pretty mix of American Foxhound with a smidge of Boxer that adds some strength to her physique. She is a lean, statuesque beauty at an athletic weight of 45 pounds. Her short, flat coat requires minimal grooming, and Mama enjoys the grooming process. Her coat mostly is white with russet brown patches, and scattered black markings on her face. Mama seems more like the elegant Boxer in personali: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. She exudes happiness and joy.

Mama has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. Mama is easy to walk on lead, and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee.

Mama would be a great choice for a moderately active single or couple, a recent retiree or senior. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Mama has excellent pack manners, and would be a great addition to a multi-dog household, perhaps as a companion to a senior dog who has lost his or her housemate. Mama is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where her golden years will be spent as the light of someone's life, rather than considered an afterthought.

Mama has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. Mama is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus) and has been boostered as needed.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noKids']",Baby,Dog,Beagle,"Our handsome Max is one of those dogs that makes us scratch our heads, and wonder how the heck such a swell dog wound up in City Animal Control. We had expected that he had been a city stray, lost, and taken to the shelter, but, NO, it was his family who abandoned this 10 month old pup. Once they did, the clock began ticking. Owner surrendered dogs only have 48 hours before they are eligible for euthanasia.

Max's behavior evaluations reflected the disoriention and fear that he displayed in the chaotic shelter environment, and he was sent to us so that we could start the training process that his former owners had neglected. Max was acquired as a puppy, and grew up with kids, but very often a puppy's training and socializing takes a backseat to the child-rearing. It's easy for a smart, alpha wannabee pup to get a leg up on a frazzled stay-at-home mom or dad.

Max is a pure bred Beagle and is a hardwired scent hound. He loves the outdoors, and can amuse himself for hours, investigating the wondrous scents that abound in nature. He bears the classic Beagle tricolors, with saddlebag markings. Max is a robust, hearty dog, with a sturdy 33 pound physique that is easy to manage. He is not an overly high energy dog, but does need a fair amout of exercise to be happy and healthy. 

Max is best suited to an adult home, with an active single, couple or retiree, who have the time to devote to Max's training. He now knows all the basic commands, and works well for food or praise. He loves the outdoors and would be an excellent walking or hiking companion. Max would be up for anything and could adapt to any kind of pace. We haven't noticed that Max is overly reactive to other dogs or sounds, and we haven't heard much barking, but we know that there is a big old Beagle ballyhoo in there somewhere. We did hear him express an opinion at the McDonalds Drive Thru, when he learned that Micky D's now serves Lobster Rolls in New England. Max will bark when he has something to say.

Max can be a great friend to other dogs his age, but he has a little of the alpha wannabe personality, and is a bit pushy within the dog pack. He could certainly join a multi-dog home, but dog chemistry will have to be tested before a final decision is made. Max wouldn't be a good fit with kids or cats.

Max is in his glorious adolescence, and has decent house manners for a youngster. He is somewhat housetrained and cratetrained, but adopters should be prepared to finetune his potty habits. As with most rescue dogs, Max has been bounced around a bit, and has lost some of his house training Mojo. He will need patience and persistence to help him to acclimate to a new routine.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Young,Dog,German Shepherd Dog,"Few things wound us as deeply as the sight of a magnificent and powerful dog, diminished by lackluster owners. Our beautiful German Shepherd, Balto, found himself in a jam, after his owners abandoned him to NYCACC. He arrived during a string of OMG Nor'Easters, and the wistful expression in his eyes reminded us of Marlon Brando's great quote in On The Waterfront, ""I coulda been a contender!""

Indeed, Balto could have been a noble service dog, a search and rescue hero, or even a fearless bomb sniffer, but his owners were at a loss to develop his magnificent potential. Instead they made him a couch potato, left him under exercised and under stimulated which led to understandable anxiety. An unemployed Herding dog without a purpose can be one of the most verklempt creatures on the planet!

When Balto arrived, he seemed alarmed at his new surroundings, and he struck us as a jittery soul, wondering what fate had in store for him. Immediately, his anxiety got the better of him, and he began to chew his tail. We were able to redirect that anxious behavior into more productive activity, and Balto has blossomed beautifully. Now he is ready to live his best life alongside a human companion who can provide the strength of leadership and training that he has missed up until now.

Balto is typical German Shepherd, and has the classic black and tan short coat with saddle bag markings. He is petite for breed standard, weighing just 70 pounds. He is a bit underweight, after a bout of intestinal parasites, and could easily carry another 10 pounds. We recommend that he maintain a lean physique for optimal health. He is on a high protein, grain free diet, with omega fats added.

Balto is an amazing dog, who exhibits the loyal, protective and extremely intelligent nature that is characteristic of the breed. He's a dog who needs sufficient exercise and mental stimulation to feel at peace with the world. He would be the ideal companion for an active couple, single, or a retiree, who can spend a lot of time with him. Balto craves human connection and bonds deeply. He's not a good candidate for a family dog: frantic young children and cats might try his patience. The best fit for Balto would be a quiet, yet active home, with folks who love to spend time outdoors.

Balto has responded beautifully to his training regimen, and he seems to find great comfort and purpose in the work. He now knows all his obedience commands. He now heels nicely and pays close attention to his handler, looking for direction. Balto loves the training regimen, and can easily move forward, in the hands of motivated adopters, to earn his Canine Good Citizenship certification, and beyond.

Balto is in excellent health, and is neutered. He is vaccinated for Rabies, Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, Parvo, Parainfluenza and Coronavirus. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noCats', 'noKids']",Adult,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Found as a stray in May 2016, he was brought to our city shelter, NYC ACC, and placed into their foster program. For the past year he has been living with a very dedicated foster mom, Becky, an avid animal welfare supporter, which is how we met them. BEAKER BUNNY has some very workable special needs (lack of confidence, shyness) that have made it difficult for him to be noticed in an overcrowded system. Our city shelter is inundated with animals in need of a home so we asked if we could pull this handsome boy into our rescue program and give him the spotlight - they said yes! in July 2017 we welcomed Beaker Bunny into our One Lucky Pup Program!

Beaker Bunny is approx. two years old, 75lbs., and politely requests a calm home outside the city. This well behaved pup knows his manners, is housebroken, neutered, microchipped and UTD on shots. While he is unsure of new situations and lacks some confidence, once he warms up (in just a few moments!) he pulls out all the stops with gentle kisses and some sweet requests for lap space. This big boy would love an owner who enjoys walks and cuddling! 

Beaker is availble for adoption in NY, NJ, CT, PA (other locations considered, within a 5 hour drive of NYC)  Adoption application: www.mrbonesandco.org/adopt

About PeeWee:
PeeWee's foster mom says he is the oddest guy! He is silly and sweet with lots of personality quirks. With a medium energy level and the ability to keep himself amused, combined with the fact that he is non-destructiveÂ when being left alone, he is a dream dog for just the right person. He loves giving LOTS of kisses and spending time with his family. He has the funniest personality to match his goofy ears.

PeeWee is a little shy when meeting new people but he quickly warms up and wants to make friends. He is very dog selective and would be best as the only dog in the house. He doesn't like being in a crate but is very well behaved when being left alone. He is housebroken and walks nicely on a leash although he much prefers hanging out in the backyard over going for a walk.

PeeWee's perfect forever family is one that has a yard for him to romp around in and has experience with terriers.

About Chubby:
According to his foster mom Chubby is a special guy who deserves a loving forever family. Chubby had a very hard start in life and had Â issues when he first got out of the shelter but he has come a long way and is ready for his forever family.

About Pepsi:
According to his foster mom Pepsi is told he is handsome by everyone who passes him. He loves to bury his head in your arm for snuggles and love. Pepsi is an energetic, friendly, and outgoing guy that enjoys spending time with his foster family. Pepsi is a cross between a kangaroo and a bloodhound. He can jump and sing.  He is eager to help you with laundry, whether is loading or unloading, he is there to offer assistance and occasionally run off with a sock.
Pepsi is housebroken, crate trained, good with strangers, kids, and other dogs. He has some minor guarding issues with his food that is being corrected. Pepsi is eager to explore everything around him and meet all animals he encounters in his path.  As a result he pulls on the leash and needs to be corrected.

About Deebo:
Deebo is a very special guy with some special needs. He is loyal and loving and longs to be with his person.
?
Deebo is housebroken and crate trained, walks nicely on leash and enjoys the company of children and other dogs. He can be a bit leery of men and prefersÂ to make those introductionsÂ at his own pace. Shortly after arriving at his foster home Deebo was diagnosed with Cushings Disease whichÂ effectsÂ his pituitary gland.Â In Deebo, it has caused increased thirst and appetite; increased andÂ sometimes uncontrollable urination; weight gain causing a potbelly look; hair loss;Â restlessness; lack of energy; and increased blood pressure. He is on medication and as long that continues along with twice yearlyÂ vet visits to monitorÂ his levels, he will continue to live a long and happy life. Due to his increased appetiteÂ Deebo is usually searching for food and will nibble fingers looking to find a hidden treat, and gets very excited at mealtimes.Â 
?
The perfect forever family for Deebo is one that can properly handle his special needs both in time and money. His medication runs an average of $120 a month. He needs a proper amount of exercise to ensure that he maintainsÂ a healthyÂ weight. A submissive doggie sibling would be welcome, children middle school age and older.",34801556,2016-03-31T17:02:45Z,yes,Deebo,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/1/?bust=1459443765&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/1/?bust=1459443765&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/1/?bust=1459443765&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/1/?bust=1459443765&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/1/?bust=1459443765&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/2/?bust=1459443766&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/2/?bust=1459443766&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/2/?bust=1459443766&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/2/?bust=1459443766&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/2/?bust=1459443766&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/3/?bust=1459443766&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/3/?bust=1459443766&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/3/?bust=1459443766&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/3/?bust=1459443766&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/34801556/3/?bust=1459443766&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY1248,05641,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,Has special needs

About Cinnamon:
Cinnamon is a pretty little girl who had a very hard start in life. While unsure of her background we can assume by her fearful behavior that she was abused in her past, mostÂ likely by a man, and as such she prefers to company of women.
?
Cinnamon is crate trained and housebroken and walks nicely on leash. She enjoys playing with toys but can get possessive so her foster mom is working with her on trading up and relinquishing the toy for something else. Due to Cinnamon's past she has issues with bitingÂ when she is upset.

About Roxy:
According to her foster dad, Roxy is a sweet girl who had a rough start in life. She loves being close to her family andÂ snuggling while taking a nap or watching TV. She is a funny girl and loves watchingÂ TV right alone with you... but only if the show is about other animals!Â 
?
Roxy is housebroken and walks nicely on leash but she can be fearful of skateboarders and very sudden movement. She is also nervous aroundÂ other dogs, so she needs to remain a single lady. Despite her nervousness she warms up quickly to strangers with proper introductions.Â 
?
The perfect forever family for Roxy is one that has a backyard for her to run around in. She loves the outdoors and would benefit from the extra exercise.

About Bubbles:
According to her foster mom, Bubbles is like velcro, she loves attention, snuggling, and sleeping between her people at night. She's playful, obedient, and a quick learner. She enjoys walking in the park and rough housing with other dogs.Â 

?Bubbles is crate trained, walks very nicely on leash, stays close when off leash, and is mostly housebroken. She loves everyone she meets, she is good with strangers, older kids, and other big dogs.. At her heart she is just a puppy and has some puppy behaviors that are being worked on like being mouthy to get attention when you stop petting her.

About King:
According to his foster mom, King is a great guy who is constant source of entertainment. He is a velcro dog who is constantly close, always ready with a slobbery kiss.Â 
?
King is housebroken, and crate trained. He can be a bit vocal when he first gets closed in but will settle nicely. He does enjoy his crate when just given free acces and will come and go as he pleases. King needs some work on the leash,Â he is still very much a puppy and does get excited and needs an experienced adopter to continue to teach him.
?
King enjoys the company of other dogs and likes to engage in running, bouncy play so a doggie sibling should have a similar play style to ensure they are a good match.
?
The perfect forever family is one with the time, patience, and experience to continue his training.

AccordingÂ to his foster dad, Rin Tin Tin is a sweet, energetic boy who is eager to please. He is still very much a puppy and as such needs training and guidance but he is eager to learn and wants nothing more then to love on his person.
?
Rin Tin Tin is crate trained, housebroken, and is learning to walk nicely on leash. He is learning commands and has almost masteredÂ sit. He enjoys long walks and car rides but should be crated or else he will want to try and drive! He does well with other friendly dogs. Rin Tin Tin is still learning not to jump up when he gets excited.
?
The perfect forever family for Rin Tin Tin is one that as the time and experience to continue his training. Doggie siblings welcome. Children juniorÂ high school age and older due to his size.",36367554,2016-09-30T19:14:50Z,yes,Rin Tin Tin,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/1/?bust=1475262891&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/1/?bust=1475262891&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/1/?bust=1475262891&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/1/?bust=1475262891&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/1/?bust=1475262891&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/2/?bust=1475262891&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/2/?bust=1475262891&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/2/?bust=1475262891&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/2/?bust=1475262891&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/2/?bust=1475262891&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/3/?bust=1475262892&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/3/?bust=1475262892&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/3/?bust=1475262892&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/3/?bust=1475262892&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36367554/3/?bust=1475262892&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY1248,14543,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs

About China:
According to her foster mom, China is an extremely easy dog who is the ultimate people pleaser. SheÂ is curious about the world around her and loves exploring and meeting people and other animals. She loves to go to the park and hike, or the indoor park to play with the dogs. She has a jacket that she loves to wear when itâs chilly out. This is the sweetest dog you will ever meet. She will just sit and look up with you with her wide, innocent quintessential âpuppy dogâ eyes and melt your heart. She loves to learn and do what youâre asking of her. If you spend the time to train her and work with her she will be an absolutely perfect dog for you. This little girl has had a rough beginning to life, but she hasnât let it dampen her spirits or her love of everyone.
?
China is housebroken, crate trained, and walks nicely on leash. She loves everyone she meets and is good with strangers, kids, other dogs, and cats.Â China has some medical issues, namely a skin condition that is of undefined origin. She is missing large patches of her fur and the skin has turned black. We are treating it and some of the skin is turning pink again, but we donât know if the fur will return. She gets weekly baths with medicated shampoo and then we apply a cream (with odor) to all the spots. She loves it because it keeps her skin from drying out and getting flaky and itchy.

The perfect forever family for China is one that has the ability to continue her care. Children school age and older just becauseÂ her tail can be a weaponÂ when she gets overexcited!Â ",36714952,2016-11-11T20:16:55Z,yes,China,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/1/?bust=1489600532&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/1/?bust=1489600532&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/1/?bust=1489600532&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/1/?bust=1489600532&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/1/?bust=1489600532&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/2/?bust=1489600532&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/2/?bust=1489600532&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/2/?bust=1489600532&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/2/?bust=1489600532&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/2/?bust=1489600532&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/3/?bust=1489600533&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/3/?bust=1489600533&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/3/?bust=1489600533&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/3/?bust=1489600533&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36714952/3/?bust=1489600533&width=50&-t.jpg']",Female,NY1248,43054,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs

No additional info,Young,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Whippet']","Marshall is a total mush! This sweetheart is 2 years old and 50 lbs.

Marshall is the happiest boy around. He is always happy to see his people. He greets everyone with his goofy smile, lots of kisses, and wagging tail .

Marshall is smart too! As soon as he is told to go to his bed, he listens. He is a gentle boy and takes treats softly out of your hand.

Although Marshall is playful and fun, he is just as happy to curl up and sleep when he is inside. He may occasionally steal a shoe to sleep with, but he never chews it or damages it in any way. He just snuggles with it. Such a goofy boy!

Marshall is medium energy. He loves going for walks or  to romp around. He finds his favorite sticks and trots along happily bringing it on a walk. He makes doggie friends easily and loves to run and play with his new friend. He can outrun just about every dog he meets.

Also, be prepared to get lots of compliments. Marshall is quite handsome and has lots of admirers. People constantly stop us to comment on how stunning Marshall is.

Although Marshall is sweet and loving, he is an anxious boy. When he gets overly scared or overwhelmed he has snapped (strangers moving very fast or if he thinks his family is in danger).  Because of this, we are looking for a home for Marshall outside of the city, and with no small children. Marshall is great with passing everyone on the street and he loves children, but given his anxiety at new things, we think he would do best living with adults who understand him and can make him feel safe and confident. 

At the end of the day, all he just wants are belly rubs. Marshall is super lovable and just wants to please.

She is such a sweetheart, she will absolutely love you forever.  Sweet Pea is being fostered in NYC.

Sweet Pea is a little shy, but once she knows you, she let's her goofy side out.  She loves to follow you around from room to room, and will curl up right next to you for a snuggle. She loves belly rubs and giving lots of kisses. She's still getting used to the hustle and bustle of NYC, but she loves going on adventures in her carrier. She's a perfect side kick as she's calmer, but still fun and playful. Sweet Pea will need a home that will be patient with her to help her build her confidence. 

In April, our sister shelter in Puerto Rico, El Faro de los Animales, conducted a harrowing rescue mission.  They received a call from someone reporting a large number of dogs not being cared for.  Their neighbor had been housing over 100 dogs but passed away last year.  After her passing, neighbors tried to help the dogs until it became too much for them. By the time they called El Faro, it was too late for some of the dogs.  Luckily it was not too late for adorable Sweet Pea.  She will be coming to NYC mid June and will be ready for adoption.

"['altered', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Hi meet Molly the snuggler. 

Molly is 3 years old, 45 pounds and so super sweet. She just loves to snuggle (both with people and other dogs!)

She loves all people and is very sweet to kids. She lives in a Foster home with other dogs, and gets along great with everyone. She just loves other dogs. She gets SO excited to see another dog on the street, so she needs a parent to reminder her to mind her manners. She doesn't understand why another dog wouldn't want to play with her. 

Molly was found tied to a pole, abandoned. We think she was used for breeding. But, you would never know about her sad past. She is the waggyest and sweetest girl. She is happy, playful, and so loving.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,"['Labrador Retriever', 'Terrier']","All puppies are cute and cuddly, right? We agree! But there's nothing...NOTHING...like the sweet soul of a senior dog! Coal, a 13-year old, 25-pound, Labrador/ terrier mix is a lot like your favorite pair of old, broken-in shoes: Cozy, comfy and irreplaceable. A new pair would NEVER feel quite the same!

Coal has been around the block so to speak, and guess what? He STILL loves to go around the block! Leash this fella up and he'll excitedly accompany you on a stroll through the 'hood, sniffing and greeting creatures along the way!

At home, he is content to sit with you on the couch (by invitation only!) or find a soft warm dog bed to plop down on. He is not separation anxiety-ridden, in-your-face kinda guy! Nice, huh? This easy-going cutie-pie has a healthy appetite, pretty much eats anything and is particularly fond of treats. Feed me, feed me, feed me! Oh, and guess what? He's also housebroken...yay!..and pad-trained too...double yay! He does not act his age and has energy! He knows simple commands such as sit and come. Coal will do best with a patient owner that understands he needs to build up trust. 

Coal does not hear as well as he did when he was a younger lad, but he navigates his world like a champ and only asks that you approach him gently so as not to startle him. He enjoys a tender touch, he hardly barks, sleeps through the night, can co-exist with other respectful dogs and isn't much of a shedder. 

Coal isn't some old, sooty, dirty, fossil fuel...nope, nope, nope! He's a sweet, floppy-eared, adorable, black-and-silver coated senior gentleman who deserves a low-key retirement home where he can hang his hat and enjoy some serious lovin'!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,Boxer,"Like fine wine, some things get even better with age! Such is the case with Casey, a calm, quiet, charming 12-year-old, 55-pound Boxer mix, who is sweetness, love and joy, all rolled up into one fabulous package of fur!

Casey is housebroken and loves being outside sniffing at all the interesting smells. Regardless of the weather conditions, she is always up for a slow meandering stroll, and sheâs so gentle and polite, that even a young child could walk this angel. She gets along well with all dogs, regardless of their size or age. Same thing with people. Anything goes! Casey is as easy-going as they come. 

This gorgeous gal is a total love sponge and will give back even more than she receives. She is especially fond of human hugs and having her head scratched!  Her only request would be to live in a home without tons of steps.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Baby,Cat,Domestic Short Hair,"Meet Phineas! This frisky fellow is a 6-month old, 4 pound (as of 5/24), black-and-white bundle of love. Phin is great with adults, kids, cats, and most likely dogs too.  Heâs also litter-box trained!

Phineas is sweet, affectionate, playful and energetic. One minute heâll be excitedly chasing a ball, the next minute heâll be on your lap cozying up to you. He is a happy, friendly, social kitty who seeks out the companionship of others. As soon as Phineas hears you in the house, he will come running to see what you are doing. Heâll sit by your side, play on your keyboard, and give you big kitten kisses whenever he can! While relaxing, Phineasâ soft, soothing purr is quite audible - - and his way of expressing gratitude, joy and contentment for being his friend. 

This handsome copper-eyed dude is a truly lovely little kitten who would be the perfect pet for any feline lover. Fur real!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Hot diggety dog, check out THIS precious peanut! His name is Mickey and heâs a sweet, mellow 9-year-old, 7-pound, housebroken Chihuahua. 

Mickey is as light as a feather and walks well on a leash, but prefers a short-n-sweet stroll. I peed, I pooped, now pick me up, pleeez! He is the absolute perfect travel buddy and enjoys being toted around in a snazzy carry-bag or better yet, in the snuggly arms of a human. 

This affectionate little fella is a master cuddler and loves being pet. He will try to make his way under the blankets and adorably cozy right up to you. Free heat, yay!

Mickey knows a few commands and is very respectful around food. He might even turn around in a circle, if you ask him nicely! He respects the boundaries of other dogs (their space, their treats, their toys) and can peacefully coexist with them. Heâd probably be fine with the felines too!

Mickey can be somewhat wary of strangers, but give him a few minutes to warm up, and heâs willing to be anyoneâs best buddy! Hint: Gently offer him a belly rub and he will just melt in your arms! Yep, thatâs right, this deserving, tender, little man is a total mush-ball who is looking to find that special someone with whom to share a lifetime of love, sweetness and joy.

altered,Senior,Dog,Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie,"This guy is almost too cute for words! Radish is a 7-pound, 10-year old Yorkie with jaw-dropping charm and lollipop sweetness. 

This pipsqueak could be the poster child for the perfect apartment dog: Low-key, quiet, pad-trained, mellow, and portable.  He is kind and gentle around other dogs, even the grumpy ones. He is friendly toward all humans - - young and old, big and small. Radish allows all manner of handling and enjoys being fawned and fussed over like heâs got celebrity status!

Radish likes going for walks, is well-mannered on a leash, and will gleefully trot by your side. In open spaces, heâll prance around like a dog half his age! At home, itâs all about snuggles, cuddles and kisses. 

This fella shares food, treats, toys, beds, and blankets, all of it.  He doesn't bark, pull, jump or beg when he wants something, although he might stare at you with his doughy eyes hoping you see him! :-) 

Radish eats well, will sleep as late as you want, travels with ease, and is just a natural-born lover yearning to find his soulmate.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Terrier,"Calling all scruffy dog lovers! Meet your new bestie ! Berry is an 8-year-old, 12.6 pound feathery-furred terrier who is beyond sweet, super spry (donât let her age fool ya!) and smart as a whip.

With the most adoring brown eyes everrr, this fetching pup is not only precious, she is also well-balanced and highly adaptable. Sheâs as happy walking with you as she is chilling out on the couch. Your choice! She gets along nicely with other dogs and is friendly and welcoming to ALL people, from the very elderly to the tiniest of tykes. Berry is mega polite and will follow your cues. She is affectionate but wonât crowd you. She enjoys treats but wonât snatch them. She is joyful but never annoying. 

Fully housebroken, all you need to do is leash up Berry and take her out to do her business. She is crate-trained too, but she would much prefer the freedom to remain next to the humans. 

Berry loves the car and will hop right in, ready for whatever adventure awaits her. Sheâll either curl up in a ball and fall asleep in your lap, or sheâll excitedly peer out the cracked window, allowing the fresh air to gently blow her wispy hair. Wanting to be wherever you are, Berry is the consummate companion dog: Cuddly, cute, kind, and a pleasure to be with.

This dudeâs a 60-pound, 3-year-old Redtick Coonhound whose unique markings, floppy ears, and chill personality make him a very endearing and personable pooch! ...p.s. his nose is okay :) 

Buddy, a fully housebroken hound, is absolutely fabulous with other dogs. He loves going for walks, running around in the dog park and playing around, but his energy level is well-balanced. Relaxing is also one of Buddyâs favorite activities! Nap-time is a treasured treat, if you ask him! This go-with-the-flow kinda fella likes to be pet and shares his possessions/food/treats with ease. He enjoys mealtime but doesn't overeat, and he never begs for table scraps. Now nice is THAT?

This handsome devil travels like a champ and rarely barks. He seems real smart and is very responsive to the command, Come Here. With a little training, we bet this boy could master a whole host of words/phrases.

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Senior,Dog,Chihuahua,"Meet Waffles, the Chihuahua mix, who is just as sweet and scrumptious as the waffles you might eat! Only this 10-year-old, 10-pound gal requires zero butter or syrup for added flavor. She is perfect just the way she is!

Waffles cannot see or hear, but her sense of smell is keen and her overall resourcefulness, outstanding. She explores the world around her by happily meandering around the dog park or outside in the yard.  She subscribes to the expression: Take time to smell the roses! 

Waffles loves being carried around, and is a relaxed and portable travel companion. She never barks, never complains, and is a friend to all. She isnât too interested in playing with other dogs, but she is great with them (even the grouchy ones!), and would probably be fine with cats too.

At home, this delightful, super-affectionate snuggle bug is a champion napper and an avid sunbather. She needs to be kept away from stairs, but can navigate her way around the house from memory and by using her nose as her guide. With just some minor adjustments to ensure her safety, this amazing and adorable fuzzball is a very easy dog to care for.

This lighthearted pup is sweet and easy-going with everyone, including little kids all petting her at once. She gets along fine with dogs and cats too! Ally is energetic, appreciates a couple of healthy robust walks, and can party like a rock star, but she also has the ability to mellow out and quietly amuse herself. When sheâs done with all of that, napping is her game of choice! Once bedtime rolls around, sheâll be down for the count and will not disturb your slumber until the following morning. 

Ally is fully housebroken, uses wee-wee pads for emergencies only, and is crate-trained. For such a little one, thatâs pretty remarkable. She is one smart cookie and always aims to please. 

This furry angel is as gentle as they come and not mouthy at all. If you didnât actually see her chewing on her bones, youâd almost think she had no teeth! Sheâd make a great addition to almost any type of household. Chipper, cheerful, and NOT needy, with lots of spirit and spunk to go around!

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Baby,Dog,"['Hound', 'Harrier']","OMG, those eyes donât even look real! Amaryllis is a 15-week old, 12-pound (as of 7/1) Hound/Hrrier mix, who is just stupid gorgeous!

This little darling is a show stopper...not just in appearance but in temperament too. Amaryllis is sweet, smart, cuddly, and playful. She gets along with other dogs and is warm and wonderful to adults and kids alike. She always finds fun, whether inside or out. Amaryllis is quickly learning the whole walking and being leashed-up routine. Sheâs also making terrific progress with housebreaking, wee-wee pads, and crate confinement. A clever canine, for sure!

Amaryllisâ tail constantly wags. She is happy, adores people, and follows her human(s) around from room to room, always keeping a watchful eye on whateverâs going on. She has boundless energy, but thereâs an off button, too. After a solid workout or some spirited playtime, sheâll happily hang out and cuddle with you, then maybe later even collapse in her bed. She sleeps through the night without any issues!

This snuggle-bunny is a lovable, funny, delightful little creature with a giant personality who, like fine wine, will only keep getting better with age. 

Puppies are hard work. If you are not ready for a 'new baby' please adopt an adult or senior who need you!  In addition, we cannot guarantee the breed, size, and age of a puppy.**

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Adult,Dog,Chihuahua,"Meet sweet petite Tulip, a 3-year-old, 15-pound cute-as-a-button Chihuahua mix. Tulipâs tiny frame houses a huge heart, and she is just bursting with personality. 

This joyful pup is fun and energetic but not in an off-the-wall sort of way. She is very chill too, and LOVES to cuddle and relax. Tulip is very friendly toward people and adores all other dogs. Whether playing with a human or a canine, this party girl knows how to have a blast!

Tulip gets super excited when itâs time for a walk and thoroughly enjoys being outside where her happiness and enthusiasm is off the charts. She also grooves on the attention she gets from all the passersby who comment on how adorable she is! 

Tulip has made great strides with housebreaking and has become nearly 100 percent reliable. Likewise, she has grown accustomed to her crate, which has helped establish a regular bathroom routine. 

This dainty doll is a gem of a dog who would be a good pet for just about anyone.

This luscious lad is a gem of a dog. Perfect in almost every single way. Reliably housebroken and very well-trained, Agave is exceptional on a leash, does not bark, does not beg, and does not shed. He is clever and knows several commands, he coexists well with other dogs, and heâs adoringly affectionate without being overly needy. He travels like a champ but doesnât mind being left home alone. Heâs a whatever-works-for-you kind of dude.

Agave can be a tad cautious around new people but warms up within seconds. Typical of tiny tykes, sudden movements scare him a bit, and he prefers being picked up gently. Just like a delicate, sweet, sensitive little baby!

With his massive ears, gentle eyes, and handsome white coat, this guy is as cute and charming as they come!

Stevie is kinda like almost the perfect dog. Soulful eyes, a waggly tail, an easy-going demeanor and a love for life that just wonât quit. This endearing angel is people-friendly, dog-friendly, and fully housebroken. She travels with ease, eats whatever you offer her, and barely makes a peep.  She loves being outside and is always super happy to take a walk. She may not come in first place for her leash-walking skills, but sheâd definitely have a shot at second or third :-). 

Between her irresistible sweetness, her good manners, and her undying loyalty, this beautiful animal is a true treasure. The real Stevie Nicks once said, I have no fear, I have only love - - and weâre pretty sure Stevie Nicks the dog would say the exact same thing if only she could speak!

His size makes him easy to travel with, and heâs totally down with that, especially if heâs being carted around in his snazzy little tote bag. Heâs a fairly quiet guy, shares all his stuff, and isnât fussy when it comes to food. 

This chunky monkey is a very mellow, easy-going, low-maintenance fella. Having someone to chill with is pretty much the key to his heart. That and a few biscuits!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Senior,Dog,Chihuahua,"Say hi to Joe! Heâs a 15-year old, 6-pound, surprisingly spry Chihuahua mix with fox-like ears and cow-like markings to match! Donât ever tell this guy heâs an old geezer! Heâll have NONE of that! He loves going for walks (just no long staircases, pleeez!), heâs playful and sociable, he gobbles up treats, he wants to be in the middle of everything, and he suffers from a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out)!

Joe is friendly around other dogs and is an over-the-top lover boy to all humans. He never saw a lap he didnât want to sit in, and if a back scratch or belly rub is involved, heâll never want to get up. Heâs super snuggly, readily accepts kisses, and enjoys being carried around like a sack of potatoes. Joe loves, loves, loves to play!

Joe is fully housebroken as long as youâre hip to his cues. Heâs accustomed to doing his business outside and heâs a pleasure on a leash, happily trotting next to you, sniffing and smiling as he moves along. He has absolutely no use for a crate. He will not make a mess at home and would much rather be near his peeps. 

This easy-going, joyful, tenderhearted, low-maintenance senior is a true treasure. Never bossy, never growly, never annoying. He has so much love in his heart and he just wants to find that special someone with whom to share it ALL!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Dachshund,"Grab little Alder while you still can! Everything about this guy screams of cuteness! Heâs a 5-year old, 13-pound Dachshund mix oozing with love and devotion. 

Alder is a tad quiet and shy at first, but give him a minute or two to get comfy, and his gooey sweet side quickly emerges. Offer him some head petting, a belly rub or a cuddle session, and heâll nearly melt in your arms or into his seat. Speaking of which, Alder always prefers to be sitting near or next to you. On top of you works too! This guy is a social fella and desires the company of humans. Heâll follow you around everywhere! Easy to get along with, he also likes hanging around other dogs. 

This handsome hot dog is FULLY housebroken and very well-mannered in the house. He does not like being confined, nor does he require it. He can handle being left alone and will never make a mess when youâre not there. 

Alder loves treats and will politely sit for them, if you ask him nicely. He loves going for walks and has the most fabulous time sniffing and smiling at all the cool stuff in his path. And if you like taking car rides, this guyâs your perfect co-pilot. He will enthusiastically hop right in and happily go wherever you wanna take him!

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,Dachshund,"Goodness gracious...such gorgeous eyes, such fabulous fur! Say howdy to Hyssop, a rockinâ 8-year old, 16-pound Dachshund mix. 

This mellow fellow is all about kisses and cuddles. Hyssop will snuggle up to you and nuzzle his nose right into yours.  A lower energy sort, he prefers short walks and long naps. He isnât too interactive with other dogs, but he clearly enjoys being in their company. He will follow them around and copy everything they do. 

This affable fellow is fully housebroken and walks well on a leash. You can pretty much do anything to him, including touching his paws, checking under his tail, or peering into the back of his mouth, should the mood ever strike!

Hyssop is one of those quiet, soft-spoken, sensitive types. He doesnât ask for much, he has so much love to give, and he has a heart of gold, to boot!  His idea of heaven would be spending his days with a wonderful human or two, along with another furry friend for extra pleasure.

Oasis is doing really well.  She is high drive working dog and needs someone who will actually work with her. We think she will be very good at SAR
A champ at Nosework
Potential flyball or frisbee dog.
she has the most amazing leaps..see video 
O. is tolerant of other dogs but wants to be the princess in your home.  Highly focused when working
She is NOT reactive on leash.  She will do anything for a ball.
She is really really sweet, just difficult around some other dogs
A diamond in the rough for the right person


Oasis and her sister Anabeth were surrendered to a NYC shelter when their owners were evicted.  The shelter did not bother to notify anyone that they were sisters.
Anabeth was adopted.  Oasis was stuck.


She seems to be a hound or lab mix and perhaps some pit in there.  
She is tall and lean.  BEAUTIFUL  A real head turner
We feel that she would be happiest as an only dog.  She does not like all other dogs.especially small ones. .  This can be worked on and RHDR will provide assistance . She seems okay with large male dogs now.
Oasis would be an amazing performance dog.....  Great for agility and  and maybe frisbee(when she learns how to catch).  She has some really fancy moves
She walks pretty well on a leash and is totally housebroken.  She would be a great running partner.
A great partner for someone who will work with her,  She can be a star

"['specialNeeds', 'altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Adult,Dog,"['American Bulldog', 'Pit Bull Terrier']","Casper is a 5 year old American Bulldog with piercing blue eyes and a love of snuggling. He is so stinkin' cute! Wants nothing more than to be on your lap, and is great with all people/strangers and even little kids! He got along well with the other dogs in his foster home and especially loves his big white boxer brother. If you have a mellow dog who is looking for a buddy, Casper is the guy for you!

Casper would prefer a work from home or stay at home owner, as he gets anxious when left for over 4 hours..... This cutie patootey just wants to be loved and reassured... are you his special person?

Casper's ""special need"" is that he is deaf (deaf dogs are awesome and easy, see: http://deafdogsrock.com/ ). He may also have some shortsightedness; though he can chase a ball just fine (boy does he love fetch!) it may contribute to his anxiety around other dogs. Due to his deafness, we'd prefer a home with a fenced yard, because if Casper can't see you, he can't ""hear"" you!",31384836,2015-02-02T11:49:59Z,yes,CASPER blue-eyed hunk,Large,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/1/?bust=1483382566&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/1/?bust=1483382566&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/1/?bust=1483382566&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/1/?bust=1483382566&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/1/?bust=1483382566&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/2/?bust=1443628481&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/2/?bust=1443628481&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/2/?bust=1443628481&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/2/?bust=1443628481&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/2/?bust=1443628481&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/3/?bust=1443628481&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/3/?bust=1443628481&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/3/?bust=1443628481&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/3/?bust=1443628481&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31384836/3/?bust=1443628481&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY773,19525,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,Has special needs
"['specialNeeds', 'altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained', 'noDogs', 'noKids']",Young,Dog,Pit Bull Terrier,"Long Island: Diesel yearns for the love and touch of humans so much that he hurt himself trying to dig his way out of his dog run while in boarding to get to the caretakers of the facility. Diesel would dig and dig and dig whenever he heard the voices of humans, he desperately wants to be with people and is so tired of being alone so much that he is hurting himself in the process. One of our volunteers was able to take him into foster for the past month and brought him to the vet to assess the situation and we found out that Diesel managed to fracture his own ankles because of his frustration. Sadly his foster is ending because our volunteer will be leaving the country and Diesel still requires follow up medical care, he canât go back to boarding in this condition. He currently is being treated for a bone infection caused by self inflicted wounds caused by his digging. His foster mom reports that Diesel is incredibly loving and just wants to be cared for to feel secure. Diesel does have limited vision but he compensates by using his other senses. Diesel is great at nose work and can find treats and toys without any help. Diesel also loves to play fetch! Diesel has shown some separation anxiety in his foster home but once he feels secure and knows he wonât be left alone it eases up a bit. Diesel really needs a kind soul to take him home so he has the opportunity to heal and build his self confidence. Diesel is 2 years old and spent the majority of his life in boarding; he likely feels all alone in this world and he wants nothing more than to be loved. We desperately need a foster or adopter to step up for him. We will pay for food, medical, and whatever else he needs if you can provide him with love. It would be best for him to be the only dog in the home due to his medical needs at this time. If Diesel returns to boarding he will likely just hurt himself again and that would be tragic. Diesel is a very special dog who lost his vision due to juvenile cataracts, his blindness doesnât get in his way he just really needs a person who is willing to work with him to get comfortable with his new surroundings, we recommend no small children even though he adores them. Heâs a real lover boy, so open your heart to him.

Luckily for China a Good Samaritan was able to watch over her and advocate for her so that she made it out of the kill shelter alive. China at first appeared to be terrified and confused by her sudden stroke of bad luck, one can imagine that being left for dead on the side of the road can be devastating to anyone. China is currently in our boarding facility where she had the chance to chill out and just relax after the whole terrible ordeal of being abandoned then hitting the euth list where she wouldâve likely died if we didnât step in. What we learned from China over the past few months is that she is pretty pawesome! China loves to take long drives, sheâs fantastic in the car. China is also a world class ball player. We noticed China hates the crate, so no biggie she doesnât have to go in one if it makes her uncomfortable. China definitely came out of her shell and shown us her potential. We are seeking an experienced foster for China, a home with no other dogs or cats.  If you would like to foster China please email rhdrdoggies@gmail.com to find out more about her. If you are sure that China is the dog you want to help please fill out our application below, making sure to answer all questions, answering n/a for those that are irrelevant or it wonât submit.

We saw her with her entire family (including a toddler) as she was being surrendered to the shelter due to a family tragedy.  Although she was very calm and relaxed with her family, we found that once away from them she has some quirks.....   Primary as her intense dislike of crate confinement.  Her original owners described her as low key, low energy.
We are finding that she is a bit out of shape and could use more exercise....
We also found that she is wary of some strangers.  
She is going to work with a trainer.
We would love to find a very experienced foster, who can work with our trainer
Is that you?  Please contact us for further information

We had pulled him for an adopter who bailed on him and he hasnât gotten one application since. Snoopy is not doing well in boarding, he is nervous and very sad. Snoopy likes his caretakers and is friendly with them but he really wants a family to call his own. What we know about him is that Snoopy has lived with his former owner since he was a few weeks old, he has lived with a 2 year old child but has been around kids of all ages. He is playful, respectful, and tolerant of the kids. He plays in an exuberant manner with adults and plays in a gentle manner with kids. He has never lived with any kind of animal and ignores dogs when walked. He has never bitten a person or animal. Snoopy has no behavior issues and will hide during storms. Snoopy is not bothered if food or a treat of any kind is touched while he is eating. He is not bothered if a toy is taken away, if pushed off furniture, if held, if disturbed while sleeping, if brushed, during nail trimming, or if someone unfamiliar approaches owner or family member. He enjoys bath time. He will bark if someone knocks on the door. Snoopy is friendly, playful, affectionate, and confident with a medium to high activity level. Snoopy likes to play with rope style toys. He likes to play tug and fetch. He is kept indoors only and sleeps in his own bed. If left home alone Snoopy is well behaved.

"['altered', 'hasShots', 'housetrained']",Young,Dog,American Staffordshire Terrier,"New Hampshire: Maui is an energetic and loving dog.  She will do best with an active family that can drain her energy.  Maui absolutely loves things like hiking in the woods in the summer, where there are lots of interesting things to smell and check out.  She would do best in a family without very young children as she sometimes is not aware of her strength and younger children could be accidentally hurt/knocked over.  She is not mouthy, but can occasionally put your wrist in her mouth when greeting you - however she doesn't bite or chew it at all, she is very gentle. Maui is quick to learn, is very treat-driven.  However, she requires a lot of consistency and repeated rewards - she can be stubborn and take her time having behaviors become learned (completed quickly without repeated asking). Maui knows signs for sit, down, stay, off.  She will sit and wait to be released to eat dinner, once you put her bowl on the floor.  Maui knows how to use a treadmill, and although requires being leashed to it so she doesn't look around and wander off it, it is a great resource for draining energy on days with very bad/inclement weather. Maui has a very high prey drive - if she sees a rabbit or squirrel run in a particular direction, she will try to go that way for several days; she also likes to chase cars. A fenced-in yard would be ideal to prevent her from racing off after small critters, if you don't want to have her tethered/leashed in some manner.  She does not like her ears touched much - sometimes soft rubs are ok but mostly she turns away from having her ears touched. Maui is extremely loving and just loves being with people.

Molly is friendly with people and  would be an ideal pet for a family with kids! She knows commands such as sit, give paw, and lay down.  Molly will behave when alone but much prefers the company of others. Molly loves to play--her toy of choice is a tennis ball, but don't expect it to last the whole day! Molly loves to run, and take long walks.  Molly is good on a leash and she is extremely housebroken, she even lets you know when she has to go out, but she does not like the rain! Water is her nemesis!!  She is on a grain free diet and LOVES to chew on bully sticks and other chews. Molly has never gone to the bathroom or destroyed any household items except fleece blankets and thatâs because she thinks they're toys!  Molly is protective of her caretakers and will bark at passers by or other dogs, but she's happy to see company when they come visit and are welcomed inside by her caretakers.  She loves belly rubs, tug of war, and couch cuddle time, and Molly is super smart.  She recognizes words like, walk, out, treat, and toy. We say things like, ""Molly, do you want to go for a walk?"" Or, ""Do you want to go out?"" And she runs to where we keep her leash.  If we say, ""Molly, do you want a treat?"" She gets excited and runs to where we keep her treats. If we say, ""Molly, go get your toy!"" She runs to her bed and pulls out a toy to play with. I'm sure with further training, you can get Molly to do lots of other things, sheâs a good student a quick learner, you just need to be persistent!  Molly is not a fan of cats at all, she has engaged with a male dog of her size and was harmonious, however she does not really like female friends.

MJ does not have any handling issues, he does not resource guard and heâs not a huge fan of toys. MJ doesnât mind being in a crate and he is quiet in the home. MJ is deserves the best possible home since his father has sacrificed everything he loves to defend our country and liberties. MJ would make a nice addition to any patriotic home because he embodies the true meaning of what it means to be an American.",40926107,2018-02-11T19:46:42Z,no,MJ,Medium,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/1/?bust=1518378349&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/1/?bust=1518378349&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/1/?bust=1518378349&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/1/?bust=1518378349&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/1/?bust=1518378349&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/2/?bust=1518378351&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/2/?bust=1518378351&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/2/?bust=1518378351&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/2/?bust=1518378351&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/2/?bust=1518378351&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/3/?bust=1518378354&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/3/?bust=1518378354&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/3/?bust=1518378354&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/3/?bust=1518378354&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/3/?bust=1518378354&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/4/?bust=1518378356&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/4/?bust=1518378356&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/4/?bust=1518378356&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/4/?bust=1518378356&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/4/?bust=1518378356&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/5/?bust=1518378360&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/5/?bust=1518378360&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/5/?bust=1518378360&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/5/?bust=1518378360&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/40926107/5/?bust=1518378360&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY773,11231,Altered,Vaccinated,Housetrained,Not cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,Has special needs

"['altered', 'hasShots']",Young,Dog,Boxer,"Meet Penny!

This gorgeous purebred boxer is only 1 year old and already needs a new home. Her family in Puerto Rico love her, but lost everything in Hurricane Maria and need to move, and cannot take her with them. But she deserves a family who won't abandon her so we will find her a forever home. 

As you can see, Penny is great with little kids. She's also great with other dogs. Boxers are smart (often stubborn) breeds so experienced owners are always best. She is fully vetted, vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. 

Penny flies to NJ in Aug.

This poor pup was found wandering a nice neighborhood in Puerto Rico, where everyone drove past him without a second look, despite how beaten up he looked. Finally an amazing group of volunteer vets picked him up and asked us to help. 

Pasta is only 6 months old but he's a big boy - he's all legs like a baby deer! He is so incredibly sweet and loving. His skin was in rough shape from living on the street, but his fur is growing back beautifully and he's looking more handsome every day. He is friendly to everyone he meets and plays well with other dogs.

Pasta is about 45 lbs and will be 60-70 when full grown. But despite his size, he doesn't need a lot of space because he just wants to be near his people. He is fully vetted, vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. 

Pasta arrives in August.

Please meet this STUNNINGLY Beautiful  Cuddler : STONE 
This wonderful and graceful 2 year young  teenager was rescued out of a stray colony in East Harlem and is nothing than a pure joy in feline affection and tender beauty.
It's barely to believe that this beautiful and sensitive kitty survived the harsh environment and maintained their calm and gentle features. 
STONE is a big and warm-hearted fellow with a magnificent royal feature in his coat, stunningly green eyes and the longest whiskers ever seen. He likes to be in charge always watching over ""his foster empire"" and particular his foster sister Louise that all are ok and content. But unlike his name, Stone is a real feline soft ball that will melt your heart the first minute you meet him. When the time is right, he let you know with head butts and deep purring sounds that he is ready for love and affection ,sitting next to you demanding being petted or  even flipping over and showing his belly to emphasize his gratitude to be safe and inside!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBjAIZiXpyg

Otherwise he can be also such a goofball as well, chasing toys, rolling around and playing with his sisters  Shelby or Louise, enjoying life in the fullest. 

Please see more pictures of this  gorgeous boy at:
https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair/5243818

As Stone is enjoying very much furry companionship and LOVES his sister Louise we would like to find for him a furever home with her.  
Stone is fully vetted with all shots, neutered/spayed, tested negative for FIV/FELV and are ready for their forever home - may be yours?

Please meet our beautiful ANGELINA - A true Feline Furball with a SPARK! 
This under 1 year old gorgeous kitty was found abandoned in a parking lot and, when approached by her rescuer, she alerted him with a tiny meow that she was desperate to get inside and of course her rescuer didn't hesitate one second to do exactly this. 

This kitty was clearly exhausted beyond belief looking for a safe place to sleep and made endless power naps in her foster home. After she felt safe and settled in comfortably, it soon became very apparent how much affection and sparkly character was hidden under her a bit reserved demeanor! 

Angelina is a real funny furball, goofy and energetic, super playful chasing balls and mousies and amusing herself endlessly with bottle corks (red wine preferred) batting them back and forth. She loves other kitties and is running with her foster siblings around and playing hide and seek as well as rubbing against them to show her love. All she wants is fun, fun, fun but also love and attention. When the time is right, she will come up to you and encourage you tenderly with her head and begging with her golden eyes to be loved, petted and feeling safe showing her true affection to you. Her favorite place is sitting next to her foster mom on her favorite chair watching TV with her and patiently waiting that she will give her some more attention during commercials. 

Her foster mom's heart is always filled with pride and joy how much Angelina developed into such a happy and affectionate young sparkling teenager, and surely she will melt your heart with her gentle demeanor and soul the first time you meet her . 

Please see more pictures at: https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair-mix-tabby/5878810

Angelina is an under one year old, healthy kitty, fully vetted including spayed, dewormed / deflead, , vaccinated, tested  negative for FIV/FELV and microchipped.

Come and meet our feline version of  Angelina Jolie and get swept away by her captivating charm!

Hi!  I'm Missy!  I'm very chatty and I like to wait for you at the front door, and I will miss you when you're gone.

I am a 2 and 1/2 year old lap  kitty and I will binge watch TV with you.  How perfect am I??    :)
I am FIV positive, but luckily leukemia negative (we know by now that FIV positive cats can live a very long life just like a normal cat).  I had all my teeth removed and my tail is only 2 inches long.  I was saved in the nick of time from the mean streets and I'm so delighted that I was rescued!!  I am VERY sweet.

Blaze is a confident cat who knows what he wants and how to get it. Thatâs why one day he sat outside my window and demanded to be let inside. Once in he walked right past my own cats and made himself right at home on the couch! He may as well own the place. Nonetheless, life hasnât been easy for Blaze, having lost half his tail while living outside. He doesnât seem to mind though, and it serves as an exclamation mark on his already unique personality! Now Blaze is eager to find his forever home and will thank his rescuer with what we call his signature headbutt nuzzle ;)",38679011,2017-07-06T17:22:01Z,no,Blaze,Large,"['http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/1/?bust=1499362345&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/1/?bust=1499362345&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/1/?bust=1499362345&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/1/?bust=1499362345&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/1/?bust=1499362345&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/2/?bust=1499362352&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/2/?bust=1499362352&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/2/?bust=1499362352&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/2/?bust=1499362352&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/2/?bust=1499362352&width=50&-t.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/3/?bust=1499362370&width=60&-pnt.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/3/?bust=1499362370&width=95&-fpm.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/3/?bust=1499362370&width=500&-x.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/3/?bust=1499362370&width=300&-pn.jpg', 'http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/38679011/3/?bust=1499362370&width=50&-t.jpg']",Male,NY874,10001,Not altered,Not vaccinated,Not housetrained,Cynophobic,Does not hate children,Not felinephobic,No special needs

This little lover boy KEANU was dumped in a community garden and immediately running up to his rescuer to ensure with the sweetest meow he is ready for a life back inside showing his tenderness and friendlyness clearly apparent. His cute face markings are giving him the purrfect finish to a true feline companion!
This loving and fun furball is that kind of feline soul that will look you straight into your eyes while being petted, will  try to give kisses and will show his deepest gratitude with an immense purring and belly exposing that you are paying attention to him and giving him a little piece of your heart. He will head-butt your extended hand every chance he get, giving paws and  expressing his joy, contentment and affection to his human buddy. 
KEANU is a true personal assistant that will welcome you at the door, circling around your legs letting you know how much he missed you and will enjoy playtime and attention to the fullest. He enjoys conversations and will always respond when you speak to him. At any time he is ready for playing and goofing around, but also likes to snuggle up and hang out on the couch watching tv with you. He also enjoys being picked up if it means he will get even more attention and love. And if he thinks you are really busy with something else he may climb on your shoulder - just making sure you don't forget him. We can only imagine what a loving affectionate boy he will be in his future furever home!  

Please see more pictures at: https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair/6727960

KEANU is a very easygoing, energetic and very playful feline fellow that really needs a playmate (would do well with a younger cat or kitten) to be completely happy! During his adventures in his future furever home he would love to have a furry partner in crime  that is not scared by a little bit of a mischievous troublemaker bouncing around.

He is about  2 year young, tested negative for FIV/FeLV and any parasites, neutered, fully vaccinated and microchipped!
Please don't hesitate to inquire about this very handsome and sweet boy who is so deserving of wonderful new life; maybe with you?

Baby Socks (grey and white) and Teetzie  (Tabby) are mother and son.

They have been living happily as part of a colony but recently Baby Socks was found injured.  Given the freezing weather, he has been recovering at a foster home with his mom - Teetzie - keeping him company.

We are hoping to find a loving, forever home for Mom & Baby Socks. She is 5 years old and Baby Socks is four.  Both are current with all shots, spayed and neutered, Felv/FIV negative and clean of any pests/parasites - internal or external.  Both are extremely friendly but shy.

Help Reggie, the FIV+ cat, find the perfect forever home! Located in Queens, NYC but we can work out logistics.

""Reggie"" has had a hard life. This ~3 year old was trapped during TNR in November, neutered, vaccinated and released again. But Reggie turned out to be very friendly and did not belong or know how to cope with life outside. He was likely an abandoned house cat, given how social he is.

Reggie was getting beat up all the time by the feral cats in the area. He was covered in wounds, both old and new. You could feel the scabs under his fur while you pet him.

One day Reggie's feeder noticed a large wound on his belly while he was rolling around on the ground. TNR Utopia was able to get him into a carrier and to the vet. Reggie was a great patient! His wound was cleaned out while under anesthesia and is healing (although it doesnât look pretty). At the vet it was also discovered that Reggie is FIV positive.

The Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) attacks the immune system, leaving the cat vulnerable to many other infections. Once adopted and kept inside with regular vet care, cats with FIV can live long and happy for many years.

A few weeks later Reggie's wound was not looking too good. Surgery to remove the infected tissue was suggested. On December 22 Reggie was operated on successfully. He did not love life with a cone and looked forward to those supervised times each day we would take it off him... :-)

On Friday, January 5 Reggie had his staples removed! The wound on his belly is completely healed and he is now ready for a forever home.

Still, through all these hardships, Reggie remains a happy cat who loves the company of people.

If you or someone you know is interested in adopting Reggie please let us know by visiting www.tnrutopia.org/adoptions or by sending an email to info@TNRutopia.org. He would be a wonderful only cat or companion to another FIV positive feline.

Hi I'm THE GREAT GATSBY- The cutest Lover Boy and BEST KISSER in Town! 
This adorable boy must have been recently abandoned by his owner who left him behind in a community garden where we maintain a feral cat colony. One of our rescuers immediately spotted him as he was anxiously meowing to get some food in his starving belly and almost screaming : please don't leave me here - I don't know where to go besides hiding in a winter shelter!"" Of course, she didn't hesitate a second to get this sweet boy off the street, tucked him into a carrier and brought him inside. 
Gatsby immediately settled into his warm and cosy condo truly exhausted but so grateful to be safe inside and taking power naps with the deepest purring sound and buiscuiting while dreaming - making him one of the most adorable kitties - especially with his cute little goatee spot under his chin!
Right away, Gatsby made also sure we knew that he is a TRUE LOVER BOY! He meows to greet you when entering the room, rubs against you and starts purring loudly and follows you until you pet him!  Once you start petting him, he will roll around on his back and demanding with his beautiful green eyes intensive belly rubs! 
We can honestly state that GATSBY is one of these rare special kitties that we call ""BORN TO BE A LOVER BOY"".  He is a super affectionate feline companion:  always ready for attention, petting and cuddle time. He has as profession ""Personal Assistant"" on his business card: always curious to know what his ""human buddy"" is doing and how he can assist him/her night and day! 

When satisfied he will thank her love and affection with a smile and kisses - YES, LOVER BOY GATSBY is a GREAT KISSER as well!! Nothing makes him more happy than to be with someone and that someone is finally there for him - as much as possible!
Of course as a young teenager, Gatsby can be very playful batting his mousy around and after enough playtime hanging out on the highest platform of the cat tree!

https://youtu.be/hODYqzAmPtc

Gatsby has been in a foster home with other cats and a dog and has been doing ok with them. But as he always wants to come first he would need a furry companion that is more laid back and can stand up for itself, thus he would be certainly great as the only feline king in his future home with lots of love,  attention and playtime .

Gatsby is under one year old boy, already neutered, dewormed/deflead, tested negative for FIV/FELV, fully vetted with all vaccinations and microchipped. 
Come and meet this affectionate and handsome snuggler, who's personality is more beautiful in life than pictures can tell and you will feel like kissed by the Charming Lover Boy Gatsby when he puts his head in your hand seeking for fun and love !

Meet the new power couple, Minka and Zorro.  Although they came from a rather humble environment, they are now shaking up the social scene.  It is difficult to showcase their charisma in a photo, but here you can see their appeal.  They tend avoid cameras after having been chased down by paparrazi.  They are a bonded pair yet a true example of âopposites attract.â  Minka is an 8 month old breathtaking beauty, a stunning multi-colored marble tabby with exotic almond-shaped eyes.  She is somewhat shy despite all the attention lavished upon her.  Nothing life in a comfortable home couldnât cure.  Zorro is an approximately 1 Â½ year old dashing black cat with big round yellow eyes.  He is a man about town, he loves to hang out with both people and other cats.  He is very vocal, he has an opinion on everything.  Minka and Zorro are neutered, vaccinated, and FIV/FeLV negative.  After leading such fabulous lives, they are ready to settle down together in a forever home, where they can play, sleep, and shower you with their love, unencumbered by the celebrity world.  Please make their wish come true!

Teddy, aka âTeddykinsâ, âThe Tedsterâ, is a handsome 7 month old brown tabby/white mix.  His exotic green/yellow/brown eyes are lined like those of an Egyptian prince.  Being a kitten, he is very energetic and playful.  He loves to chase balls, a laser pointer, anything that moves.  Teddy is friendly and affectionate, he is a super sweet snuggle bug in the making.  He loves to reach up with his face and give you kisses.  Teddy gets along well with other cats.  Being the Don Juan that he is, he especially loves older female cats.  Teddy is a very lucky kitten as he was humanely trapped on a cold winter night after he crossed Broadway on his way to Dunkin Donuts.  Teddy lacked human contact for the first few weeks of his life, but he made an amazingly quick adjustment to his caretakers.  He is now ready for his forever home.  Like many of his generation, Teddy requires a grain-free diet.  Teddy is neutered, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV negative, and microchipped.  This real live Teddy bear is waiting to go home with you and share his love!

Please meet Gorgeous Affectionate BOOBOO! 

GOSH - HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL can a kitty be and still being overlooked so many times because he is just not into a cat walk photo shoot!  BOOBOO is a magnificent young boy, with beautiful features, an adorable face with eyes begging for love and wrapping his paws around your hands being so grateful to get attention.  This young boy is an affectionate boy even at the beginning a little bit shy as he has been through a lot in his young life, but amazingly kept his feline spirit, being curious and playful, loves cheek and chin rubbing time and LOVES to headbutt his foster Mom showing his pure soul to her. BOOBOO is a beautiful and gentle feline soul with a big heart that will make you smile each time you return home, and then he will be all yours: a true feline companion, sitting next to you and cuddle around while you are watching TV. His favorite time is definitively bed time: He calls out his foster Mom that he is ready for snuggle time and when she lays down he is absolutely delighted, chirping around and put his head deep right next to her chest and purrs for satisfaction. 
BOOBOO will need someone who appreciates his sensitive feline heart and can spend time with him so he can adjust in no time in his new home . He also LOVES to play and fool around , chasing around and just enjoying furry companionship - thus he will do well in a home with a laidback furry companion but will always insist that he is the closest to you and your heart!
Please see more video's of BooBoo at: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM7keMMxvMQ 

https://youtu.be/7mrM-gZu1Hw

When Booboo is assured that life can be full of loving care and happiness he will adjust in his new home in no time and purr and goof around, showing off his belly and invite you with purring sound to join him on his trip of happiness!

Besides being super playful, being little trouble makers and eager to engage with their foster Mom whenever she has time, they are one of most precious kitten pair we ever rescued. Both kittens are just magnificent inside out showing already off their silky black coat and displaying their beautiful Bombay heritage,
BOTH are already the biggest purring and chirping machines when next to you and trying to get your attention. During nap time, both try to sleep on top of their foster mom making sure that they are as close as possible and are the most excellent snugglers anyone can only wish for...AND DAILY BELLY RUBS ARE MANDATORY!!!! .
Of course their favorite occupation is running around, playing with their toys by carrying them around in their mouth, chasing each other playing hide and seek or chasing ice cubes - their favorite toy!, engaging with the residential cats or with their foster Mom hoping she has time to play with them.
They will be soon fully vetted and neutered but can already move to their future home as foster to adopt family members. 
Come and Meet Noel & Hogan in real life and enjoy the kitty heaven They are more beautiful in life than pictures ever can tell!

The New York City Feral Cat Initiative (NYCFCI) is posting this ad as a courtesy for the rescuer named above.  

The NYCFCI is not fostering this cat and cannot process adoption applications.

If you like to gamble and you are feeling lucky, you canât lose with Blackjack and Domino.  Domino is a big bundle of love; he is an extremely friendly cat who adapts quickly to new environments.  The giant black splotch on his nose and bent ear make him even more unique and endearing.  Blackjack, a stunning tuxedo with big green eyes, is more introspective.  His loving nature will emerge as he gets to know you.  Blackjack and Domino are most likely brothers, approximately 5 years old.  It appears that these wonderful cats were cruelly abandoned by their owner, as they were already neutered when rescued.  They were discovered living behind an HVAC unit of a building on the Upper West Side.  Several residents were feeding them, but the smell of the food entered a business through the HVAC and their presence was threatened.  They were rescued just in time, the odds were definitely in their favor.  Since their rescue they have been evaluated by a vet and given clean bills of health.  They were given all vaccinations and are FIV/FeLV negative.  Blackjack has been microchipped.  You hit the jackpot when you adopt these winning cats!!
