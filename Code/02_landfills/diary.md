Some things:

- I will change my mind about exactly what extra things I want in my dataset, or whwat form (wide vs. long) I want my dataframes in, and end up doing alot of stuff in a really strange order that makes my code flow very poor. Perhaps if I plan ahead more in the beginning, I will avoid making this kind of mistake.

- Thinking about annotation has really helped alot. Now that I'm considering my graphics within the context of a narrative, and I'm less afraid to add a bit of text, the charts I've made seem like something that don't necessarily need to be surrounded by tons of text.

- I feel like I'm doing alot of manual alignment of subtitles and titles, for some reason I'm not getting the built in commands to do what I want them to do.
