Some things:

- This data has extremely inconsistent structure. Each row represents one recorded incident rather than a single death, so some of the cells have a few items (e.g. country of origin), while some only have one

- What is the best way to compare countries of origin?

- How can i represent this data other than a line graph?

- Didn't design this uniformly and I can't really do it in HTML
